I deserve the watch as I decided exactly one year ago to stop being a lazy slob and commit to walking 5 miles per day. It's now 1 year later, and I have no idea where I am! So having the mapping features will help me find my way home 😄
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I am a coach with my local running club and also a Scout Leader. The map feature will be very helpful, especially if it works well in the "foresty, foresty or whatever is up there" bits! The more metrics I have for myself, the better coach I can be as I will be able to teach my athletes about them and help them improve. The solar charging will be extremely helpful on Scout camp too. I am also interested in the new HRV. My Dad had a massive heart attack last year and they think it might be hereditary. Great video guys, very informative.
Great in-depth review 👏
The daily suggestions for a race event = my favourite feature and the reason why I have bought this watch!
I think I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I am running the London Marathon this year after 7/8 failed ballot attempts. 👍👌 Every time I got a rejection I was secretly pleased because I am not a runner, but London is the bucket list dream. 👌👊 I was so shocked to get a place and have started actually taking training very seriously and ran my first half last weekend with a dodgy old FR235. 😄 It would be nice to use the look ahead feature as that sounded really interesting, but I’m not sure about the morning recap as I’m still clinging onto no sleep and recovery habits yet!! Thanks for the info 👌👍
I deserve the FR955 because I’m 60 years old - just started Crossfit less than 3 years ago, but feeling so much more fit and planning to hike the Grand Canyon Rim to Rim in 2 weeks.  YIKES!  Have never owned a fitness watch like this, so stoked about all the help it would offer me! 🤓🙌🏼
I deserve the new Garmin Forerunner 955 because I love running, walking and generally all types of exercise.  As an older runner, I like the idea of the ‘training readiness’ feature, which would help me undertake my first marathon.  I am also super keen on the size of the watch face, as I won’t have to run with my contact lenses in place. Joys of getting older.
I would love this watch to help me jump start my recovery of post-COVID POTS. Definitely overkill but will equip me with everything I need to track metrics for my recovery! Watch looks killer. Good luck everyone!
I deserve the new Garmin ForeRunner 955 because I love keeping fit frequently every week with motivation and reviewed used near all features in detail, watch abilities in Run, Cycle, Swim, Walk, Hike, prior to linking with Styrd.
I deserve this watch because I've put major focus into my physical health by taking up a number of sports that I have no tracking against. I started riding, running, hiking and walking on a daily basis. I also started cold water bobbing after a morning run in the beautiful city of Cape Town - to reset my physical and mental well being, I'd love the 955 to brag about my accomplishments in social circles, track my health and become a part of Garmin's statistics to drive development in software updates as well as future devices. I'm also a big bug fan of the brand's devices and would love to be a brand ambassador for Garmin during my fitness regimes.
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because I have made a long term commitment to running and have ran at least one mile everyday for the last 290 days. Day 300 is coming up! I typically run more than a mile per day usually about 25 miles per week and a ton of that is trail miles. Thanks for the consideration Garmin! Sweet watch btw!
New to Garmin-your video shared a lot of stuff which I will find helpful Thank you
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because after having a spinal op and learning to walk again I’m now defying the doctors expectations and running. I want to do this for me and to inspire others!
I deserve the new Forerunner 95 because I started training for my first ultra marathon back in August of last year. Over 1800km, the birth of our first baby, and the wettest and most humid summer Sydney has seen later, my race got pushed back to October. A new watch would be that extra push needed to keep training strong till raceday.
I deserve a FR955 because.. well I don't really deserve it, but would like to win it so I can use it to hopefully improve my running fitness and smash out some PBs. I love running and listen and watch all i can to help improve my knowledge. Thank you for this opportunity.
I deserve a FR955 because I am in my late 40's, recently decided to get my butt in shape,  lost 130 lbs and in the process picked up running as a result.   The FR955 would be an awesome tool to help me advance in running and train for my first half marathon.
I deserve a FR955 because I love cycling and the outdoor lifestyle. With 60 years of road cycling and over 150,000 miles in legs. 
I've been riding for over 60 years. I ride every day.
I am the happiest when on the bike.
I need a FR955 because I am in a stressful time.

I am a sucker for a classic alu frame, skinny tyres, rim brakes.
What really matters is to be active with passion and sharing that experience with others.
I think I can do a lot more with this Garmin. Opportunity to enhance the cycling experience. Finding inspiration in the details and feeling peace in the neverending horizon. So much to take in, so much left to explore...
Cycling has a massive positive impact on my life and I will never take that for granted.
My mental spa.
I deserve the new garmin FR955 because I recently got into triathlon after taking a 4 year hiatus from sport due to two hip surgeries I had. I was 12 months off needing a Hip replacement aged 18. All recovered now, this new watch would give the opportunity to explore freedom through running, cycling and swimming and achieve what I never thought would be possible 💜
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I have recently dipped my toes into trail running and need maps in my life so I feel safe and won'tget lost forever! Also about to start a  training block for my first half marathon. But most importantly it would fit perfectly on my Garmin watch tan line! 💛
I think I may deserve a new 955 as my Fenix5s is finally getting old with battery life dwindling.
PS: All of the major new features being presented in a relaxing way that’s nice to listen to.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I did my first sub 3 at the Edinburgh marathon on Sunday, and I’m not sure my legs will ever be the same!!
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I have started training with a method called Maffetone. Extremely frustrating running slow but looking at a shiny new watch might make it a little less painful 👀 looking to complete some half marathons later this year improving my times using this new way of training. 😁
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 solar because I am overweight and lazy! I know, I know “a watch won’t make you healthy”. I  am beginning training for our upcoming wedding…lord help me! I have a suit I desperately need to fit into. Not sure butter and a shoe horn will get me into it! The map function is helpful because I get lost when stepping into the backyard. 

To be honest, I’ve taken up running as a meditation, and exercise training. I really like that this watch has the race day set up and the morning breakdown. Setting up points to let friends and family know where I am in a race when I hit a mark, is great! Also, the find my phone option! 

I’ve liked and subscribed! Love the casual and thorough review!!
I deserve a FR955 because I’m taking on the Outlaw Nottingham in July and this watch is made for long days out like that! The addition of the solar charging might relive the small stress that my watch will run out of battery halfway through the marathon (meaning the shame of my Strava not being right..). The race widget sounds awesome for planning & pacing the whole day and it feeds my data geek obsession for recording everything! One more thing, I need a couple of new doorstops and the “seriously dench” instruction manuals sound ideal!
I believe I might deserve the new Garmin FR955 because on Sunday I attempted to run the Edinburgh half marathon and failed pretty miserably. I was on track for a shiny new PB when nature 'called' for the second time that morning... (spicy wagamamas and a can of lager the night before was maybe not the best fuelling strategy 👀). As I was trying to seek out water and a potential portaloo I lost concentration, tripped myself up and almost face-planted. Thankfully I stopped myself, however in the process of doing so I pulled all the tendons in my left foot and had to do a 'hobble-of-shame' to a portaloo with a rather swollen foot and then get a bus to the finish line after only running five miles 🙈 I believe the new Garmin FR955 features such 'up-ahead' could help me in future races to be better prepared and avoid further clumsy scenarios. In addition the live tracking feature would be useful as I had to hobble and wipe my salty tears completely alone on Sunday as there was no event live tracking. The stamina feature could also prove beneficial as there is a strong possibility my stomach upset and lack of concentration were as a result of fatigue and silly pacing.  And finally the mention of the solar battery could also prove very useful as I'm hoping to complete a 70.3 Ironman in September to commemorate the end of my 20's. I think with my tortoise-paced swimming, my inability to clip in to my bike and the fact that I have a purple foot and I'm not sure how/if/when I'll run again, I could do with all the battery-life (and help) I can get to get me to the finish line😬
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I have been doing general running and athletics for my local athletics club for many years. I have competed in both 800m and 1500m and have done reasonably well in both but have lost out many times because I haven’t paced my self correctly. If I were to have this watch I would be able to pace myself better and hopefully get on the top step of the podium more often. Also I have recently entered into my first full triathlon as I have been unable to do one because of being under 16. The watch would really help as my current Garmin 245 does not have a triathlon mode. Having the triathlon mode would also encourage me into doing longer triathlons in the future.
I deserve the new Garmin forerunner 955 because I’ve been working in a hospital Covid unit for the past 2 years now. Been running and dropping weight so far as I gained 60lbs during the pandemic due to high stress in my Covid unit . Thank you
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I seriously want to get in better shape and have a decent GPS watch for hiking and exploring more of my country. As a student money is quite short, but I know for sure this watch will motivate me to get out more and not stay inside studying for hours which is bad for the health. Thanks for the excellent review! I like Wiggle🤩
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 as I have just recovered from an ACL injury and can use a sportswatch to keep me motivated during my condition build-up. Btw, thanks for the excellent information in the video!
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because last year I decided to have a go at trail running instead of road. For this I picked a half marathon race up 2 munros - and got 6 months of achillies issues for my trouble!
I deserve the new Forerunner 955 because I've had to replace the rubber strap keeper on all my previous Garmin watches, so a Garmin watch that has a replacement in the box is a dream come true.
I deserve the new Garmin forerunner 955 because I am trying to come back to triathlons after having a child and my old 935 is rapidly giving up the ghost. Accurate metrics are such a massive motivator for me as an individual and since my example seems to inspire people around me they also benefit the community.
I deserve a FR955 because for a few years I was running with my phone in pocket, what was really uncomfortable. And even this incovenience I have never bought smartwatch with GPS, but I believe new Garmin might begin a new chapter in my running world. :)
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I train twice a day every day while maintaining a full time job and could really benefit from the HRV data and stress score data to optimise my training!
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I’m a high school runners who’s taken my training to the next level. I need this watch, not only to track my runs, but also my heart rate and sleep.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955, as i planning to do a triathlon this year and i really want to track all the key metrics of my performance. Thank you
I deserve the new Garmin forerunner 955 because it’s one of the best garmin watches ever! I run in the woods a lot and the gos accuracy on my current watch isn’t that good. Especially when I am doing speed work in the woods the paces aren’t precise, this is annoying since I want to analyse my run as good as possible. The new health features are also something really handy for me, I am a high performance triathlete who trains around 20+ hours while going to school. With these health features I can see if the body is ready for a hard workout or not. The touchscreen is also something which I think is a very nice feature to have, because it will make it easier to do things on your watch.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955  because I make up words, too. (Although I don’t have a random bike wheel hanging on my wall; maybe that’s what I need to become ‘seriously bench’)
😀
Great reviews, Gus - thanks!! 👍
I believe I deserve the FR955 due to where I’m currently at with my fitness journey. 

Between 2017 and 2021 I was able to get from 123KG down to 90KG. Becoming a personal trainer and other various roles at my local gym. 

After a few set backs in 2021 with my personal life, I unfortunately crept back up to 117KG and lost all love for any sport. But after a lot of reflecting, IM BACK! 

I’m now currently training for a 50K run (that is the end of Oct 2022) in aid of the children’s unit at my local hospital as the cause is close to my heart. And now have 2 annual events I intend on enduring on their behalf. 

Always striving to get better and be better 🤍

Thank you. 
Ry.
deserve this gorgeous garmin, as this sad nhs nurse has just come back from a funeral of one of patients, yet another one of my favourite patients I've looked after for years, lost to Covid 😢 and this new garmin would really cheer me up. It would really help my running, cycling, swimming training especially for events, chasing Pbs and keep me sane
I deserve a FR955 because due to the whole pandemic situation i started running and completed my first half marathon in April. Time to step up my game with the FR955.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I completed my first ever trail marathon last weekend at the Maverick Exmoor trail run and was out for many hours in the sun, so the solar capabilities would be amazing for me and the more adventures I have planned 🌞⌚️🤞
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because although I am not a professional runner, I am a mother of two kids and a Mathematics teacher, who performs various tests on her children and students so that they can analyze the graphs of their races during my classes. I take advantage of these moments to make you aware of the importance of solar panels and solar recharging in a watch of this caliber seems extraordinary to me. I must also say that at almost 50 years old, I run between 8 and 10 km every day, in addition to doing calisthenics, and I would love to know what my physiological age is, which I estimate to be much lower than my physical age. On the other hand, I have to say that I love that Garmin put a touch screen on this watch. Thank you very much for the videos that explain the operation of this extraordinary device.
I deserve the new Garmin Forerunner 955 because I love running, I've been running and training with a club for half my life since I was 14 and am 28 now! I've had my first baby in November so I'm now running with a buggy and slowly getting my running fitness back. I have the Great North Run and Yorkshire marathon to train for this year and winning this prize would be amazing and help with my training! 🤩🏃‍♀️
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because I am training for my first ever triathlon and a shiny new watch would go very nicely with the wetsuit I picked out mostly because it looked cool. 3 years ago I couldn't even run a mile and the most I would have recorded was the walk to the shop for crisps... having lost about 5 stone in weight and completely changed my lifestyle, I now run and cycle regularly. That said, I am very slow and so the battery life will be well tested :)
Is it good for cycling too? Is the VO2 also generated of cycling activities?
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I like to keep on track of my health & fitness journey.  I'm getting back in shape, lost some weight, and now I enjoy running, hiking, cycling, kayaking, walking, maybe a wee bit of running - I'm getting back in the swing of it.   Thanks for the opportunity to participate ; )
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 as I am a student turning pro athlete in Skimountaineering. From the 1st of November on I will be paid by the national army for my sport successes. Therefore I will ditch my studies in mechanical engineering to some degree. So far I can not afford a gps watch of this level - and I won’t in close future, since there are different things I need to prioritize. Things like moving close to my training center, paying coach and trainingcamps will cost me a lot. And I am so into this neat piece of tech. It will surely help me develop physically.
Cheers for this nice review.
Finn
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because I could replace my FR245 and get longer battery life and all the great cool new features that were so eloquently described in this excellent review.  Wiggle is my favourite place to shop for running-related items and I would like to be an ambassador for them by winning this watch and telling all my friends and family about my fantastic experience with Wiggle 😊❤
I deserve a FR955 because although all the features look amazing and will help improve my running, having something that will help me find my phone will save me hours of hunting around my home is a "game changer"
I deserve a FR955 solar because I got the most out of my FR235 and FR935 in the past 8 years of my sports adventure life. These Garmin watches withness the old zero sport me hardly complete a 10k in 70 min. I trained with FR235 > FR935, achieving 10k - 39min; Full marathon - 2h57; 24hrs ultramarathon - 193km; MARATHON DES SABLES - finisher in 2018 and many other road and trail races ... ... I am raising my game to another level that I would love to support by FR955 solar's long battery hrs, super-accurate MULTI-BAND GNSS, touch screen to help me to negative the map, race planning (Up Ahead) feature and all the useful software that help me to program my training.
I deserve the be Garmin FR955 because I am hard working and well determined rider looking to take my training to the next level and the Garmin could well make that transition much easier with the use of maps, and heart rate checks to help measure my progression.
I deserved FR 955 because after 2 years of not running, this watch will serve me and kick my butt up for starting back to running and putting away my stomach!
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I'm starting to race iTTs, circuit races and duathlons and it would be an amazing upgrade from the Garmin 235, which I absolutely love!
I deserve the FR955 as I got into Running and cycling following lockdown through humanitarian fundraisers, since then I have reman part in over 20 events raising thousands and intend to continue for the foreseeable future. The watch will aid me with my training to keep me consistent and help me improve further. Currently nursing a broken collarbone following a cycling event the watch will really cheer me up!
I deserve a Garmin FR955 because I have covid since March 2020 and I don’t work yet. I have to do sport to train my heart and my body. But I have to control all parameters about my body to do the good effort to not be tired after effort. Thanks for the video I learn some little things.
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because I’m running the London Marathon this October fundraising for the Samaritans and this watch would be amazing for training and race day! 

The watch can record so many activities which will keep training varied. Live event tracking will keep my family updated on race day and the music storage will keep me going (when the going gets tough!). The multi-band GPS and map features look awesome too.

Great comp, fingers crossed!
I deserve a new forerunner 955 because I got a puncture on my back tyre on my commute this morning that was a nightmare to change. Once done I set off and a dropped chain caused me to slip and the pedal gouged my right shin. So after this I think I'll need a forerunner so I can track my runs to work instead!
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I've clocked 8 consecutive ParkRun PBs using a woefully synical fitness tracker and I'd love to see what I can do with an accurate GPS signal- my Strava following will be so proud 😂
The Garmin Forerunner 955 can use the external Polar sensors? And if they do, they work towards the Watt measuring?
I deserve a FR955 because I used to be a nail bitter as well, I see you (🙂). I've opted to spend that time running and training others as part of my recovery journey - 🙂🙂🙂🙂
I deserve the new Garmin  fr955 because I'm a larger lad, trying to get into trail running and my sense of direction is terrible! I love cycling, swimming and  hiking and this would definitely help!
I deserve a FR955 because I am so excited to use all the new features for my third ironman after missing my first due to back surgery (I am happy to say that I am mostly healed and back out there training!) and missing my second due to terrible luck getting COVID 4 days before IM Arizona.  I am a full time statistician with two kids so I'd love to incorporate all the new data garmin provides which should hopefully give me more time back with my kids since training for an Ironman feels like a full time job itself.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I am training for a 52km trail race this September and I haven't even run a marathon before! Will definitely need the extra battery life!

I'm also currently shoeless as I keep buying shoes online which don't fit! Legs want to run 21 milers, feet say 10 is enough...
I deserve this watch because I’m training for some ultra marathons, lost 100lbs in 3 years and I haven’t taken a day off running in over 2 years. No days off, no excuses just hard work and discipline every day!
I deserve the new Garmin ForeRunner 955 because I have been into sports all my life and have never had the opportunity to track my activities to better my performance. I recently ran my first half marathon and my phone died mid way which made me lose strava mapping. I have even gifted smartwatches to my friends, but has never had one of my own. I have heard a lot about garmin and would love to have one for all my sports activities, hikes, sleep cycle and heartrate. Thank you!
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because I need to train without my mother!! The lightweight solar powered smartwatch harvests the sunlight making it light years ahead. The touch screen, colour display makes even the drabbest training session exciting. The interchangeable straps fit for all occasions, training sessions and routes. My mum would be totally redundant! Except for the odd hot cup of tea!
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because I’m still rocking a FR620 and pardon the pun… but that thing has had a long run! This new FR955 will help me continue chasing fitness for the next decade while actually tracking my overall health.
I deserve a FR955 because I need a more versatile and accurate GPS watch as I begin my progression from a runner to a triathlete. I have been using the Forerunner 45 for the past few years to track my runs, but now having recently started open water swimming, I've discovered that the GPS tracking is atrociously bad in water! The multi-band GPS in the FR955 looks like a game-changer in this respect. The other two features that would help me a lot are the music storage and the maps feature, which will not only enable me to stop lugging my phone around, but should also help prevent me from taking the wrong path on trail races (an annoyingly frequent occurrence!).
Interesting review! After several weeks of using my 955 I noticed that even if the barometric pressure decrease, watchface barometer trend arrow does not change... For example, this morning (08/50) pressure was 1009.4 mbar. After about 5 hours (13/55) pressure decreased to 1005.2 mbar but barometer trend arrow is still flat... The barometer plot is set to 6-Hour option. Does anyone know how much amount of pressure is needed and in how much time for make the arrow change direction? Any info would be appreciated )
I have a forerunner 935 it is starting to play up , so  would love to upgrade to a 955
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because having the latest technology on my wrist will help me continue to understand that even though I’m getting older I can still achieve PBs at all distances.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I am just recovering from a hip injury and am really looking forward to getting back into running, swimming and cycling as I have been limited in the past 6 months!
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because i've completely burn out some fenixes so it's time to do a stress test on Garmin now :p Plus i really need a watch that battery really lasts during my full weekend activites, the 49h of gps tracking would be very sweet :)
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I lost my garmin edge 130 a few weeks ago after a ride and I've looked EVERYWHERE for it. So all I've got is my really old garmin watch, the battery life really isn't great anymore. I'd love to win this so much!!
I DESERVE THE GARMIN FR955 BECAUSE i am a truck driver and i started taking care of my health now by exercising and running. So i think this watch will really help me keep in track and stay fit.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I will use it to the max when trail-running ⛰️, city-running 🏙️, cycling 🚵‍♂️, hiking 🏞️and maybe swimming 🏊🏽‍♂️. This will bring some sought-after accuracy to my activities. (Gps from phone is usually wobbly and Strava is always too optimistic with the pace and distance 😂)
Hi, I deserve or in fact my colleague deserves, as he is a sport master being a diabetic he is running on flat, running in mountains, working with kids, showing them how to train. He is showing that being a diabetic is not a disaster and motivates other people to change their life. He is a teacher with lot of passion and strong will. Of course he can be seen on his FB or YT channel. Thank you.
Can you tell me if the Garmin 955 is the same size screen as the 255??
I deserve the garmin fr955 because I had an accident with my motorbike that almost cost me my leg. Now, 100 days after that I am visiting a rehabilitation pool which during the process I learned swimming!! So a garmin is the best gift to track my performance in the water and if I will walk without any problems with running  in the future!!
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because after now 48 yearts of life I now want to start running. The watch would be a great motivation. Greetings from germany.
I deserve the new garmin FR955 because I completed the Goggins 4x4x48 a while back. And struggled with battery life on my old watch this would last the whole thing without top ups.  With this I may have another go (but maybe not,😉) 🤞🤞
I deserve the new Forerunner 955 because I want to treat my lovely husband. Whilst he is still suffering, 18 months in, from Long Covid, he is trying really hard to get back to dome kind of fitness levels he had before. He is trying everything he can and having the new tools this supplies will help him manage his efforts to control all the set backs he keeps facing. The stamina feature & holistic data view will definitely do this! HRV will be really good too as HR is something he has to be very aware of.
I deserve the new Garmin FR55 as I am retuning from injury and have my first triathlon in September to aim for! However, training is proving tricky after 6 months out and I am in desperate need of some help pacing
I deserve the new Garmin FR955, because I wish to have best running watch and in other occasion can not afford it. Video is good and explanation is clear for all.
I deserve the new Garmin 955 because I’m a new runner at 60 and I need all the help I can get! I love the idea of the solar power too
I deserve the Forerunner 955 as the new training widgets will help me to push my fitness to the next level & I can inspire more people for the sport with it! Thanks
I deserve the garmin FR955 because due to only recently getting the upgrade to the 945 from the 935 I feel I can’t really justify spending the money on another new watch purchase and with marathon training starting soon the new features of the watch like the stamina mode or the training readiness to keep me going for longer and stronger to beat my pb from last year and get me that elusive sub2.50 marathon time 🙌🏻💪🏻
I need this watch because i started training for my 1st marathon would be useful tankyou God bless
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because my old watch underestimates my distance. I dont want to always be half a mile behind. And it would look super cool on my wrist with that shiny rim sucking up the solar rays to keep me riding all day long.
I don't deserve the new Garmin FR955 but my lovely partner Karina does deserve it. She is training for a half marathon and I think this would be a lovely gift for her.
I deserve the new Garmin FR 955 because I’ve been running every day for the past 887 days and plan to keep going so a new Garmin would not only an awesome reward but also encouragement to keep it up. I also love the fact it’s solar charging, lightweight and has so many other extras compared to my current garmin. Please 😊
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because…

My current running watch is grossly inaccurate. I can’t even tell what side of the road I’m running on when I look back at my runs. 😫

Really, after 20+ years of smoking I began running a few years ago and I’ve never looked back. I remember my first run being around .2 miles, and now, I’m preparing for my first marathon and have my eyes set on an Ironman. My family has a healthier, more active father because I decided to lace up a pair of sneakers and take off. Thanks for supporting people like me with great product reviews.
I deserve the FR955 because it's been 90 days since I quit smoking after 30 year smoking life and this morning I just succeeded 5km running for the first time.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 for the reason I will now outline. Bare with me here... Whilst out on one of my regular endurance runs last week I came across a pathway that seemed new to me. Eager to explore a new route I was horrified to learn that it was actually a wormhole in disguise. I was sucked into the upside down, much like Stanger Things, only worse. My existing Garmin watch showed a huge spike in my HR and it became clear, I was in trouble. I bravely fought my way through a maze of horror and turmoil. After what seemed like forever, although was actually only 2k according to the Garmin, I found a small light at the end of a tunnel. Despite my training status being unproductive I was able to muster the strength to begin my ascent back to my realm. But then, disaster! So close to escape my wrist was grabbed hold of by a Demogorgon! We fought the battle of my life and I escaped by the slimmest of margins. I was horrified upon my return to see that in the heat of battle, my Garmin had been torn from my wrist. I ran to the safety of home as quickly as I could and despite my best efforts, none of this was uploaded to Garmin Connect! By wining the new FR955 I am certain the new morning report will also save me from this experience again. Worst case, incident detection should send me some help! Thanks for sticking with me!
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I am running the London Marathon for the first time this October and it will help me with my training progress. I use a Garmin currently but might need something with a longer battery life, although I should finish in less than 49 hours 😂 

I've never ran farther than a half marathon, which I only did in lockdown around villages near me, so I could do with all the help I can get!
i deserve a FR955 because maybe i'm the only runner who follows you from morocco and who participates in this contest :)
otherwise i have been running since 2009
i have since used several gardgets like nike+ sportwatch the nike+ app then adidas gps then garmin FR45
finaly thx a lot for this opportunity
it's time to upgrade to a higher class range
Great info. Would you still buy it after nearly 2 years ?
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because it’s my birthday soon and it’s about time I replaced my old Forerunner.  I love the sun and my new watch will now too!  And I’m always low on battery and regularity get lost 🤣- win win! 🙏🍰
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 is because I am tired of forgetting where I am at when I am in a flow state during my run.  Nothing worse than stopping to look at your phone to see which way you need to turn.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because, 2 years ago I was involved in an accident. The left my old Garmin Vivo Active HR a bit mangled. The accident occurred on my road bike, I was overtaken at the crest of a hill(11% descent on the otherside) by a pickup with a Kayak in the bed. Going down the hill, the pick up is accelerating away from me getting close to the 60mph speed limit, when all of a sudden the Kayak is launched from the bed of the pickup a couple meters into the air. It lands in the opposite lane, before sliding directly towards me and taking my front wheel out at about 40mph.
I deserve a Forerunner 955 because I don't want to be an after runner. While hindsight is useful, there's nothing like taking part and knowing where you're going! Some say you can see where you've been accurately with this one!
I deserve a FR955 because at 63 I have recently taken up mountain trail running. A limerick for the occasion: There was an old codger named Euan, who's tatty old kit needs renewing, then he saw a review of a Garmin brand new, which soon on his wrist he'll be viewing.
I deserve the new Garmin 955 because my 945 still works! It’s a rockstar but only 30 hours.  I need the 48 hours so I can do MOAB. I need the touch screen.   I need this watch.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because my old 735XT died as I was running my first marathon, the Edinburgh Marathon. I’m a student that’s strapped for cash but I’m starting my training for my first Ironman next summer. The watch sounds and would be amazing!
I deserve a FR955 because I have been using Garmin watches since the 310XT, and recently passed 50 000km with the 910XT 😁 using it on the bike and on the run.(occasionnaly on the swim)
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because a while back when you made a post on YouTube asking if you wear a smart watch I said I was rocking the 935 and waiting for the new 955 to be announced and if you had any inside information but never got a response 😆
I deserve an FR955 because I managed the dream of my life  at my 50 years old . I've completed a IronMan 140.6 for which I had been training for 3 years and this is just the beginning of the great adventure of my life . All done with my Garmin 920xt who accompanies me.  a very cordial hug
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I am an obese 45 year old man trying to find every bit of inspiration to turn my life around.  I was injured 10 years ago in my back that prevented me from exercising  and working out. Its only in the  last year that the pain has subsided  enough that   I have been able to start walking more and now today jog to get to 3 miles.  With an amazing new tool like this  I can  feel every bit inspired to  deserve this  and  turn myself around.
How fast will it find gps signals? I live i copenhagen and my instinct is very slow and annoying when i have buildings around in the city
I deserve the FR955 because it will help me continue my fitness journey. I love to find my running power - make me feel like the Duracell bunny 😊
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I so patiently waiting for the Garmin Enduro to be on my Birthday table and now don’t want to wait another year desperately keeping up my hopes.
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because my Vivoactive3 doesn't have the battery life any more to sustain my longer runs over 20 miles.  I wear it all day, everyday and Garmin produce stylish watches that motivate me to ensure that I hit my step and floor goals each day
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because not only will it help me track my performance and progress for my runs but I will commit to spending all my time sharing this around and being an amazing advocate for the 955!! Promise :D
I deserve the new Garmin FR955. Garmin all the way, they have been my life blood for the past four years. As someone who battles with P TSD. Autism and ADHD it keeps me focused and extremely determined, I can track my progress running, weight training and walking with the family aswell as our weekly family competition of who has the most steps per week. The stress monitor is a useful tool giving me indication how I am managing my stress levels. They are packed with many useful tools and keeps me connected so I don't miss the latest gossip. They say women can talk men just text, tweet and Instagram. Please consider me carefully you will be helping me a great deal with an update Garmin no forgetting to charge the watch and realising before a run or gym session it's about to die, praying it will charge enough in the car before your session. Good luck to everyone God bless Steve.
I deserve the new Garmin fr955 because my old Garmin broke and I can't live without one!! 😍
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because as I am heading to 50 years old, need assistance to run/train smart to avoid injury and general aches and pains. Of course believer in no pain no gain 😜
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because I'm a 45 year old female who has just begun her fitness journey after going through covid , loss of a loved one and many more personal obstacles. 💝
I deserve the forerunner 955 because I have a need to get my old self back into shape for running races. I am a long time Garmin lover and this would really make my old heart swell
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because my old suunto watch keeps thinking I'm half round the country during my runs and ride, as the GPS is resetting. Got some excellent Strava PBs though as I can now run 100kms in seconds. So if you ever here a sonic boom across southern England, it's me breaking the sound barrier on my weekly 10kms from London to Devon!
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because I’d love to have a watch to track more accurately my runs, my Fenix 3 sometimes gets lost on my runs out there and I bet it’s on its last legs!
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I am planning to do Philly Marathon on November, Chicago Marathon 2023, Ironman 70.3 Boulder and multiple half marathons and triathlon. My apple watch just cannot keep up till end of my runs or triathlons.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because after a lot of health issues, been operated from a mioma, and ppractising triathlon since just 2018 (never done sports in my life before and started when I was 47), I'm preparing for Mi first Ironman in Italy this year, and going to try also Patagonman next year. Really this new Garmin could help me a lot, specially as a very big motivation💪💪😎😎
I deserve the garmin fr955 because I'm from Brazil and here the cost + taxes is worth more than 8 minimum wages and it's IMPOSSIBLE to get one, this is true! And I would really make a good use of it! Thanks a lot and cheers!
I deserve the new Garmin Forerunner 955 because I've worked hard to get in good running shape to the point that I need the long battery life for 100mi+ events. My current, old, tattered, scratched watch just doesn't cut it anymore and needs to be charged on the go during longer events.
I deserve the new FR955 because triathlon is my path and I strongly believe in the power of the universe and how the solar can recharge us. I, we have the inner power and with the new FR955, it's the best way to maximize that kind of power, concerning our natural environment. I hope to wear it soon.
Love real high tech stuff and a solar powered touch screen smart watch is really neat high tech
Which one is best in battery life?
Oh I so deserve the new Garmin Fore Runner 955. I could GPS my way off the sofa and do some exercise or I could get up in time to do some exercise and as I live in New Zealand where we have heaps of sunshine I can make the most of the solar glass to do some exercise. I’m also not on the run (literally) so I don’t mind being GPS tracked. I could actually find my way to where I parked the car.
I deserve a FR955 because I've never once moaned when one of your packages has arrived and it didn't contain a pack of Haribo! If you prefer a sensible answer, I'd like to move up from Olympic and Sprint Triathlons to Middle and Long course and this would be the mega tool to help me on the way. Multiband GPS helps with the accuracy! I'd also love to see my running power too!
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I ran 22 loops of the Suffolk Backyard Ultra last Saturday and spent at least 45 miles of it ‘wiggling’ like a penguin due to my stomach not quite liking the forced cocktail of quavers, sour patch kids and cola 🤣 The goal is to train for a 2023 top ten place, maybe the 955 can help 😉🐧
I deserve the new Garmin Forerunner 955 because I broke my hip mountain biking, have needed 2* operations and now I'm trying to get back into training and get back into shape and get up to speed again.... The watch would be the business for me monitoring my recovery and especially the tracking accuracy as I do most of my training in dense woods and forests... The event notifications might come in handy too if (and when) I crash again 😳
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I am studying to be a medical student and it would be amazing to track my running, cycling, and swimming quickly and easily - it's so cool! There's no harm-in giving me a Garmin 😉
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because father’s day is coming up and we can’t afford any watches. My dad is my hero and i can’t even imagine how happy he will be if he can even get a smart watch.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I’m trying to piani geniali my self above of what I think I can do, with three kids, a full job in the military, I’ll try an ultra running of 80km!!!!
I deserve the new Garmin Forerunner 955,
Because currently I'm a Poor-runner Aged 45,
The features are phenomenal; that's easy to see,
It'll definitely help me achieve that sought-after PB!
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I have to schedule my runs around my wife's serious mental health issues, often running 5k, 10k or even half marathons with my youngest in his buggy! Now things are settling I can run "on my own" and it would be nice to do it properly!
I don't deserve a FR955. But I want one!  I've got a Fenix 5s I've been using since 2018. Excited to consider upgrading this summer.
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because I am always late, and since I mostly need to run to catch up to the time lost, it would be great to use it to systematically improve my run times as well, thus being less late!! :)
i think i deserve this watch as i actually watched the whole video and realised that from 16.29 the sound doesnt work! also, i would love to show this off when going for my first marathon next month.
I deserve the New Garmin Forerunner 955 because I'm currently preparing for my first Ironman while finishing my masters degree in finance. So all the expenses are already adding up faster than they should and this watch would be a sweet little extra portion of motivation and also make my preparation better by providing mor data for my daily workouts, recovery and sleep.
I deserve a Garmin Forerunner 955 because the menu button on my Garmin Vivoactive that I bought in 2015 just stopped working.  I never replaced my Vivoactive because imo it was perfect... long battery life, fun apps, great visability.  While it would break my heart to see my vivo go, not being able to access apps is a good place to retire it.  If I get it I guarantee I'll still be wearing it 15 years from now as long as it stays in working order.
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because… I’ve done approximately 10 hours (no exaggeration!!) of research on what smart watch to get my boyfriend Alex for his birthday. I started with zero knowledge of smart watches, and now here I am turning my nose up at ones that don’t have things like an Acute Load feature (which is something I didn’t even know existed a week ago 😂). I’m certain the FR955 is perfect for him (he’s big into his running and the features are perfect for his training/lifestyle), but unfortunately is way out of my price range. Winning this would make his year, and mine too! I’d love it if he could have the experience of using a watch like this! Thanks for the video, it was super helpful ☺️ Hope he doesn’t see this 😬🤞
Alice
I deserve a new Garmin FR955 because I tore my hip flexor at the 16th mile of the Edinburgh marathon and need cheared up. Especially since i had to be wheeled to the sweep up bus on a bike. So as well the disappoint of failing to finish I had the embarrassment of getting pushed on the back of very small bike 😄
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because then at least part of my would look stylish, be at it’s best on sunny days and always deliver a tip, top performance.
One question : with a protection on screen is the solar system operational ?
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I really need that daily report and stamina info to keep me kicking butt. Plus the live track updates would stop my poor partner worrying if I've had another incident!!!
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because for no other good reason I love Garmin watches and could do with an update, looks very nice 👍
I have liked and subscibed to your channel.

I deserve a FR955 because, as a 49yo I never own Garmin Smartwatch. It's expensive to own one. I usually use STRAVA to record my runs and rides.
I deserve the Garmun fr955 because of my motivation and the helpfulness of the gadgets.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because  I am fed up of my current watch not tracking me properly, I run where there is a lot of trees and getting fed up of it showing me all over the place or just disappearing for a while, the accuracy of the Garmin FR955 would be a massive bonus, as I'd know what I'd done each time
Running Power works only with HR?
I deserve the garmin 955 because I'm a crossfit athlete, competing all over Europe since 2015, with workouts that include running, swimming,weightlifting,gymnastics combined and it would be the best upgrade to my 935!!
I deserve the Garmin Forerunner 995 so I can use all the extra features (really like that training readings) instead of actually just doing the training, because that bits way harder!
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I need to know how far up ahead it is before the next drink station and if I will make it there before my legs cramp up completely in my marathon
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because due to rising fuel prices and my Wiggle-habit, i'll now be running or cycling everywhere to save cash (for more running & cycling products) so i could do with the improved GPS accuracy to ensure i don't get lost, along with the increased battery life. The new Stamina function will also let me know whether i can make it to my destination on time!
I deserve a FR955 because I was fortunate enough to get selected to run for Gibraltar in the marathon at this summers commonwealth games but unfortunate enough that I'm not sure my current watches battery will last the race.
I deserve the Forerunner FR955 because I’m going to take it on a journey. Hopefully it will arrive in time for the Croyde Ocean triathlon billed as one of the toughest triathlons in the UK. 49 hours of GPS tracking will just be enough to see me round. I’m also planning to take the Watch to Tanzania for the Ultra X next year which will also test out the battery and advanced GPS tracking over 5 days and 250K of running. My wife suggested if I get eaten by big game during the event that the FR955 will be fully charged due to the solar screen allowing identification of my
remains and enable my family to claim on my life insurance. Finally I deserve the FR955 so I can claim bragging rights at my local triathlon club, WVTri near Market Harborough who doesn’t want to be seen with the newest technology on their wrist and  continue to be the man with all the gear and no idea. P.S make sure to include Wiggle Haribo in the parcel - the postman loves it and ensures on time delivery every time.
I deserve Garmin 955 because my current Garmin is getting sad and beaten up after 6 years of use and I would love to have another Garmin to love!
I deserve a FR955 because my 935 battery is getting pretty limited and I'm hoping to be able to start training for Ironmans again after finally mostly recovering from a multi-year injury.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I’m running my first marathon in September and I need a watch just as prestigious as a marathon to train and then race with.
I deserve the new Garmin Forerunner 955 because mine is still stuck in Evri's delivery depot having ordered it from yourselves on Wednesday. It should have been delivered today (Friday) but now isn't likely to be!
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because my old 935 is at the end of its life after taking me through my first half and marathon and the runs in between.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 as I have just moved to Switzerland, don’t know anyone, and I really want to take on those mountains first hand and make myself proud by tracking the overall progress on this until I can run and cycle uphill better and stronger!
Very good,really wrist watch for all with solar and other things
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I’ve spent so much time inside over the last two years I’m paler than a white bucket, solar glass may just encourage me to get more sun!
Hi .. Do I need to have Garmin chest strap ? I have polar H9 so I believe it will work together. :)
I deserve the Garmin Forerunner 955 solar because why the hell not :). I was never a long distance runner growing up and have grew to be a little obsessed with pushing myself to get better at running. Currently running at least 3 miles a day and needing a better tracking partner ;) Pick me !!!!
I deserve a FR955 because my toddlers, aged 3 and 1, love to steal my FR935 to play with the clicks and watch the green light of the HRM, so I can have an extra watch for me
I probably don't deserve the new Garmin FR955 because there are some really great and worthy athletes on here.  HOWEVER my (getting rather ancient and worn) 745xt is on my wrist telling me when I need a break from desk work, and I could really do with some guidance on race readiness (so I run when I need to run, instead of just when the sun is shining) and stamina (I usually peak too early).  Like you (James), I'm used to the garmin ecosystem buttons but the 955 looks like it imporves on the start button loads (well, the up/down button) for starting yet another variety of activity.  I already have a Garmin heart rate band, and I'm already using lots of the intelligence eg balance during running, but the new multi-band GPS sounds fantastic!
hey, love the video.
I deserve the FR 955 because I lost 35kg stopped smoking and started running and im looking for a good sports watch to help me monitor the process. I have changed my life, I was 155kg and now im 120kg and going strong :) doing sports every day and living healthy.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because....well to be honest I dont deserve it anymore than anyone else on here but after 2 pants years it would be awesome.  Well done to the winner and dont waste this opportunity to better yourself.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because the Stamina and Training Readiness features would be huge for helping achieve my training and racing goals -that and the Find my Phone tool will drastically reduce my swearing and cursing when it’s lost and I’m late for work.
I deserve the garmin fr955 because I am entitled!! Lol there I was honest! No but seriously, so awesome that one can finally touch the screen to quickly move maps around instead of several different buttons. :)
I deserve the FR 955 because I'm great as getting lost whilst trail running  and could seriously do with the stamina feature that Gabs shows to know when I need to call for help 🤣
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because  I’ve had the previous model for YEARS and it’s very tired and a little stinky. Need that new solar power to keep me going on my long runs
I deserve to win the new forerunner 955 because I have been very good this year, I’ve charged my old watch regularly and waited patiently while it struggles to pick up the satellites. I’ve not complained when the battery dies mid run even in the blazing sun. I’ve headed out each morning even when my body aches for rest with out the 955 I just don’t think I can perform my best.
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because I’m running Hadrian’s Wall for The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity on 8th July and I’m worried my current FR245 battery wont last the 19hrs I’m hoping to do it in!
I deserve ( would very much love) the new Garmin forerunner 955 because being a nurse in the NHS means I’ll never be able to afford it🤷‍♂️p.s. nothing wrong with a dirty screen it means you used it👍
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I would like to tell the time and not get lost 😂 plus, I do SwimRuns and this is the first watch I've seen that has that sport input!
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I need to confirm my apparent world record pace of 12:30 for the 5km. My time/distance is currently measured whilst running with a measuring wheel and portable sun dial. Current set up has an estimated accuracy of +/- 10 mins….
I deserve the Forerunner 955 because I've spent the past 3 years tapering/carb loading and need to use the amazing technology to turn me into a swoon worthy running Adonis capable of majestic athletics feats.
I deserve a FR955 because I'm tried REALLY hard to beat my 5k PR, which I haven't even come close to since 2013. Also, I don't even have a cool wiggle coffee mug like you, so I feel like the 955 might help me make up for that failure. LOL!
I deserve a FR955 as I’ve been patiently waiting whilst my FR935 battery cell dies for Garmin to add solar charging to a lightweight tri watch
I deserve the new FR955 because it looks amazing and my wrist is missing a smart watch, my training will go even further!!
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I am going to do the west highland way with my mom... She is really serious about losing the way so it would be an awesome upgrade from my 910.
I don’t know who actually deserves one of these, but I will share my story. Working at a Covid site has really taken its toll. Staying healthy while trying to increase my running lifestyle, has helped both physically and mentally. I do not feel that I deserve a watch any more than anyone else who is posting on here. I apologize, as I know you had requested humor, but where I am at, we do not have much humor, just trying to survive every day. Thank you for listening, and please stay safe, and healthy.
I deserve a FR955 because my dads currently in hospital and I want to raise awareness of his condition (pulmonary fibrosis) by running as many events as I can. The watch would be a massive help achieving my goals.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I love the team at Wiggle (sucking up done), I love the map feature with touch screen for ultras (when I do one) and the range of sports it can track. So please pick me ✋.  Top review thank you.
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because I nearly died in a cycle accident last year and since then got nerve damage and cannot cycle outside anymore because wearing a helemet causes too much pain... Just going indoors now and started running and hiking and so on
I deserve an FR955 because it helps me outdo myself and give my best on every ultra trail.
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because, I've never owned a device like this before, and it will really help me achieve new goals and meet new fitness challenges.  Also, where can I get a Wiggle mug like the one in the video?☺️
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I fail all my runs w/o a watch, whenever I run on my own I usually abort it (vs. planned run) with some obscure, whimpy reason.  When my old watch worked it kept me going as it reminded me of "....I ain't done yet".   xD
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because it has my name on it - well, at least partly (FRanz). ;)

I deserve it because I would be using it 8-12h a week for different sports like badminton, running, strength, HIIT, Biking and Climbing.

I deserve it because I want to compare it to Polar and want to convince myself that your statement of it being the best running watch is right.

And I deserve it because I need guided training assistance to not overtrain my body - even after 1-2 decades of a lot of sports (vo2max66).

Albeit I don’t only want to be the nice Austrian guy but one time the lucky 🍀 nice one too ;)

Good review. Greetings from Vienna.
I deserve a fr955 because... I was involved in a cycling/car accident 10 weeks ago which had destroyed my old 735xt!! Iv missed out on ironman 70.3 Majorca but hoping to be coming back strong, ready for outlaw x in September. So really would love to win this watch.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I’m still running on the 935, and it’s really starting to show its age - much like me!
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because I plan to more trail running and I need that crazy battery life :)
I deserve the new garmin forerunner 955 solar because my vivoactive 3 has started to die and won't stay charged for more than a short jog.  However my garmin edge 530 is working fine, so cycling it is.  This is great apart from I want to have a go at triathlon and can't do that swimming and running with a bike computer.  Plus the FR955 is solar which means here in Sunny Somerset it will never ever need charging.  (I may have made that last bit up)
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because best things goes to those that least deserve them, but who will get through great lenghts to reach the full potential of this watch, in order to reach their own full potential.
Yep, that's me, starting a new journey, big changes, would tilt to wear the 955 as my first run watch.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I sometimes train without my Wife and often get lost. And showing which side of the road I’m on is great,  Incase I get mixamatoeses 🙃
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because...

Held together by elastic band during my last race,
Thankfully, at least, I could see my average pace.

A new watch I decide, as reward, for my next 26.2, 
'No need' says my husband with a grin, 'I have some Superglue!'

So now I'm stuck, quite literally, but you might rescue me, 
I have a chance to win this watch, and it's all for free!

So, on my long run yesterday, my creative juices flowing, 
I know it will help me when I run and bike, and even when I'm rowing!

The touch screen and the detailed map are the perfect added function, 
To help me take the correct turn at every single junction.

No waiting for the GPS, or for the watch to charge,
The 955 really packs a punch, and it's not too large.

I can share my run route with him with my precise location,
He can text and say 'The dinner's on' and I'll get a notification!

So if I get my Wiggle on and the sun's shining down on me,
With the new Forerunner on my wrist I'll be catching Kipchoge!

😁
I deserve a FR955 because...
Well actually I don't, however I would really like it as I could then give my current Garmin watch to a runner who is starting to get a bit more passionate about the sport and would like to record more accurate data than say a phone app could ever manage.  I have also been caught out on runs in the past where the battery has expired after a few hours so the solar option on the new *Garmin Forerunner 955*  would certainly help, especially as I have an ulltra planned for August (Tour of Skiddaw - in the Lake District)
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because I just started doing ultras and need a watch that can fit that type of training.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I'm trying to get my 100m dash down to 4 seconds and think this might really help 🏃🏼‍♀️🌺💕😉 !!!! (seriously though I'm training for a marathon)
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because I stuck a little bit after 2 yr of Covid and now I need motivation and good trainer on my wrist.
I deserve the new Garmin Forerunner 955 because... I still do not own a sportswatch and this one looks like a killer! WOW! 🚴🏻‍♂️
I deserve the new Forerunner 955 because you have a fine head of hair, Gabs has luscious locks yet I'm balding! It would also be an interesting experiment to see if the extra reflection from my forehead would improve the solar charge.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I love analysing my running data. It is very convenient when my wife asks me to take the bins out, as I can tell her that I still need 19 hours of recovery.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I’m about to start my training plan for my first ever marathon, and where better to start than with London, raising as much money as I can for air ambulance.
I deserve a FR955 because I have never had any form of measurable power ... I once held onto an Adams family electric shock machine for 42 seconds which whilst impressive, was over 20 years ago.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I have been injured for 3 years and I need something to get excited about running again.HRV means a lot to me about my training
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because it will prevent me from getting lost (which happens wayyyyy too often) when leading runs with RunWildMCR, a free running club for everyone located in central Manchester. We are all about vibes, supportiveness, mental health, and providing a safe environment to run in the city of Manchester where too often people are afraid to run at night. Also my watch battery is abysmal 😭
I deserve the Garmin Forerunner 955 because….
Well I don’t know why, I just do mate. But also useful to track training and the Achilles injury I’m struggling with currently, especially the  early morning stiffness
I think I deserve to win this Garmin Forerunner 955 as I am running London Marathon this year, which is my first marathon and I may need the 49hrs battery life as it may take me that long! Don’t want to risk my current watch running out and if it isn’t on Strava, it didn’t happen 🤷‍♀️😂
I deserve a forerunner 955 because my wife won't let me buy one, and I'm a good subscriber :)
I deserve the new FR955 as it would be great to use in my half Ironman in a few weeks
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I love running! ❤️
I deserve the new Garmin Forerunner 955 because I would gift it to my lovely running boyfriend and make him very happy. He's been a fan of Garmin watches for a while and this one would help him train for his next Belfast Marathon 😀
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because shiny new technology is always a good motivation tool, especially in Triathlon season
I deserve a FR955 because I tore my bicep tendon and want to get back into running while recovering Having a companion that keeps me in the lower heart rate zone and shows me the way would be amazing!
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because I love to improve my PR in 5K, 10K, 1/2 Marathon and Full Marathon. It is the best running watch ever.
I deserve the Forerunner 955 because I’d like to get a more updated watch compared to my Forerunner 935, I train for Triathlon/Duathlon everyday and wish to get more updated metrics to help me with my training. I’ve also had problems with gps with my 935, because I have multiple friends with 935, and all our paces are different it confuses me
I deserve the new Garmin forerunner 955 because I want a good watch to be able to improve my training and recovery. Plus, garmin watches have good battery so I am able to do ultra distance events and not worry about battery life.
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because I started running last year and I hold my phone to track my activity on Strava and get bullied by my running club members for still not having a watch 😭🤣 They have photos of me in races looking at my phone when I'm checking my pace, but they think I'm playing Solitaire 😬 

I will be running my first ever marathon in London on October, with a charity place raising thousands, and my training starts next week. Ideally I need a watch now and what better way to get started than with the top of the range running watch from Garmin 🙂
I deserve the new garmin FR955 because I am a fitness freak. I do running, swimming and strength workout. Running is my favourite activity.
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because I have a rare case of epilepsy and the doctors suggest that running will help eliminate the frequency of seizures.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because it’s pretty sweet, I like the new HRV feature, music storage so I can stop taking my phone out on my runs .. it’s the perfect runners watch as mentioned on your video .. 
Plus another good reason is you are not offering your wiggle mug as a prize :( 😁
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because I've just done the Cycle For A Cure 2022 fundraiser for the type 1 diabetes charity JDRF. I was using another brand of less than reliable smart watch and on a few occasions it failed to log all of my miles.. back out on the bike it was, chugging glucose tablets to keep my sugar levels up 🙃
I deserve the new Garmin FR955... because I'm worth it! And I really need a replacement for my forerunner 735xt which has served me well but needs a long rest 😪 😅.
The sound cuts off at the 'how big is it' section ...
I deserve it so that I can finally bin my FR405.  It was great, but even Garmin refuses to change the battery anymore.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I have an Apple Watch that doesn’t track half my activity and I have to use electricity to charge it! 
‘Save the trees and go solar!!’ 
I think the FR955 and it’s accurate GPS would also help to track the trails I take when out on in the forest compared to the apply watch
I deserve the garmin FR955 because it’s time for a new watch and this looks top notch (poet). 
Plus I need up ahead because if anyone is going to forget part of a course it’s me. 😁

I deserve the Garmin 955 as I am going to train for my first marathon.
I deserve the Garmin Frontrunner 955 because as a Race Walker I need to get my Wiggle on, especially after my current watch has just broken.
I deserve the FR955 because I can give it to my other half for 3 reasons, her current FR645 cuts out after 50miles of the London Ride 100 (even though it was at 61%), so I had 50miles of whining, which I couldn’t get away from. It continually loses connection, so I have to keep re-connecting it for her. And following watching the video, I can program the route into it that’ll stop her asking which way on the runs we do. God I hope she doesn’t read this.
I deserve a FR955 because… well actually I don’t, but my girlfriend does. She’s a great swimmer, hates running and is a new, nervous cyclist. This hasn’t stopped her doing the London Marathon, RideLondon and getting her London Classics medal (before me). She’s incredibly determined and has her sights set on swimming Windermere next year. She needs a watch upgrade to track her open water swimming and that Live Event Sharing will let us family and friends share in it even when she’s far out of sight.
Hi, I really like to feel the stamina feature and test myself. Please send it to me and I share the accuracy of that can be judged. Like the whole style not very heavy looking as the Fenix series. 🚲💪👍🙃

I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because it will look great on my wrist 😁
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because I’m running a 180km ultra and my current Garmin only lasts for 8 hours and if I don’t record the whole race, we all know it didn’t happen!
I deserve the Garmin Forerunner 955, because I need the extra battery life for my live sharing link! 😂 Especially for some of my big bike plans ahead! I’ve also destroyed my old Garmin watch from multiple MTB falls, I don’t think it’s very happy anymore😂
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I just bought the FR945 ...  🤦‍♂I was searching for 945 setup/review videos and stumbled across this...
Hallo ! Great video. I'm Nicola, a chill teacher in an international school in the center of Paris, where teacher salary IS QUESTIONABLE! However, I live and breathe running, rowing, and cycling. And skiing, when it's cold enough/altitude is good. I'm looking to participate in an Ironman 70.3 or full ironman in Belgrade in the summer, this watch would be unimaginable for that! Thanks for your consideration!

I deserve the new Garmin fr955 because I was made redundant from my pharmacy job during COVID (a blessing in disguise 😂), had an operation 😳 and gained 2 stones😞.  Since then I started two jobs, one in the NHS👍 and other in a school 🤗 cos I'm crazy, like the challenge and giving back. I've had a Son ( not literally as I'm a man) and got my twin girls into running 🙃 when they are not watching TV 😁😄. Gabs you're my hero. I want to do an Ironman, what is it like? I would use every feature on this watch.

I deserve the the garmin FR955 because 
1. I finished my osteopathy degree and I need some happiness after the four years of no sunlight studying. Could do with the solar power now that I can a ctually see the sun! Also the touch screen would be epic for these hands, may teach me to be more delicate 
2.  I also am wanting to train for my first ever iron man with all this free time but my current garmin navigation sends me in circle and my GPS doesn’t work. So would be nice to explore something more than my street!
3. Also university cost me a fortune so would be good to actually win something!!
I deserve a FR955 because I was once told I could never run a marathon. So I went and ran one.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I need to a good reason to run 😁, maybe I can get a new motivation seeing my improvements 🏃‍♂️

I deserve a FR955 because my 6 year old vivoactive can't keep up with me past an hour of activity, even when I'm not in forestry and the leaves whatever up above. Goal is to complete my first half ironman next year... hoping I  won't be too slow but to finish within an hour seems overly ambitious
I deserve the new Garmin FR956 because I forget to charge my watch far to often and spend as much time charging my watch as I do running.

Love to win the Garmin 4Runner watch for my lovely wife bustin a gut doing park run as her Fitbit is rubbish 🙏
I deserve a forerunner 955 because I have 6 month old twins and it’s would be a great motivational boost and a great reason to get back out training 😂
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because it’s my birthday on the 12th of June and this would be an awesome watch to have
I deserve a FR955 because… I just signed up for my first century bike ride and need to know if it’s time for coffee and cake!
I deserve it because I am a fat lad with great expectations and difficult goals. Up in the mountains (Snowdonia) a lot and my mrs is crazy that something will happen with me while I am overdoing things without having Garmin data of my current energy level and going missing if my watch dies during an ultra or having an accident without the incident detection.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I want to wiggle my way through the dench product information and safety booklets whilst pointing the watch at the sun so that I save on my electricity bills. Shame that in the UK means getting rained on, good job it comes with a charging cable :-D
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because this will get me ready to go back on the roads and trails rather than on the treadmill. The incident detection I can use because I got hit in the back of the head with a bat and had to walk 2 miles home to tell the wife and call the police. I am also get lost on when on runs, the mapping can really help me.
I deserve the new forerunner because I ran a 50km mountain trail at the weekend and I had to record it in 3 parts because my watch died, recharged it at a CP, died again and just recorded on my phone! 🤦🏻‍♀️🤞🏻
I deserve a FR955 because it would be a major upgrade over my fitbit HR with a failing battery.
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because, im a high school runner with a mid phone, i dont have a watch and i cant afford a lot of garmin gear, i would like the watch to be able to use it as a semi phone and i would love it for running activities and the gym
I deserve a Garmin forerunner 955 as I've waited before my 50th last year when there were rumours for it to be finally released..
I deserve the new forerunner 955 because the super powers it will give me will hopefully cure my old man hip so I can get properly out on the trails again!!!
My husband deserves the new Garmin fr 955 as it would help him train for the London marathon. I would also like to know where he is incase he's up to no good 😉
I need the Garmin FR955 because I don’t have one.☹️
I deserve the new Garmin Forerunner 955 because I could never afford such a watch and instead of using just my phone and a cheapo chest strap I think I could really step up my running with this watch.
I deserve the Garmin Forerunnet FR955 because I want to keep Garmin in my life while training, show it off and tell the story.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 solar because i usually run at nighttime and i like having expensive pieces of equipment attached to my body while running from some fellow people who probably want to "try it" and see its "features". Also i have some difficult to hear stuff especially in the last chapters of the video
I don't really "deserve" a FR955 because frankly, I'm not a triathlete, or even a particularly good runner. I don't really use any of the fancy built in metrics like HRV, training load, running power, music, or any of that. But I still "want" it though, but that's pretty much only for my vanity's sake - the "how big is it" part of your review was the only part that really caught my interest. I'd like a bigger watch than my current FR245, because it just looks more bad ass and makes me feel more bad ass, lol. That's pretty much my main motivation. As a previously over weight middle age guy I started running about two years ago and just did my first marathon, solo, in 3:39, and now I've got all kinds of hubris, wanting to run a sub20 5k, do trail ultras, and yada yada, and getting this watch is another aspect of that same hubris I believe. I mean, I'm pretty sure that just looking at the damn thing on my wrist would inspire me to try to be as good as the actual good runners who actually "deserve" to wear these. To me, that joy of inspiration is what's fun about this kind of tech, a lot more than the actual "tech" :P
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because I need to record the full extent of my wiggling around the Ironman Ireland course; I don’t want to get to the end and it not have counted!
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I decided to book in for my first 70.3 in July having never anything like it before. #nutter. Tried to do it last year but broke my elbow following a drunk fall, so now training again and absolutely pooping myself about it. Have the most basic Garmin at the moment which is years old but hoping it will get me round. I need this watch in my life!!!
I deserve a FR955 because Rasmus Hagberg in 2022 edition obviously comes without a watch. All in all i have some nice updates compared to previous years. Batery time is longer. Not because of technichal updates but a, soon to be, 4 months old baby has included an emergency start option. Full functionality can't be promised in this mode. I wish I existed in solar edition but since small children aren't aloud to get exposed to sun I havn't really seen any this year. I do know that navigating this foresty trail in life would feel easier if the pretty average Rasmus would get the long awaited update of a Garmin on his pretty average wrist.
I need the new Garmin FR955 because navigating this adulting thing tends to run my battery low...hopefully the solar on this can help me find a sense of direction :P
I deserve the Garmin 955 because my fr235 it's enough beaten up by scratches and rocks from me wearing it since 6+years ago doing everything in day to daylife (even hours of lawn mowing). Soon it will give up on me 😅
I deserve a Garmin FR955 because it will be great to monitor my activity😄❤️
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 my stamina has gone and I need solar enery to reboot my mojo in a quick touchy touchy multiconnectivity way......and I dont want to get lost ever again.....
I deserve a FR955 because I’m drowning in potential smart watches to buy and can’t stop researching.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because it's my birthday and I need to record just how much I'm not doing in order to get back to my pre-COVID fitness level
I think I deserve this Garmin FR995 because when I tried to buy one my wife nearly suffered with heart failure, so to protect my wife and make me really happy I guess I’m the winner. Good luck peeps
I deserve the garmin FR955 because i'm a tall and very thin runner and always wanted to know if a 46mm watch could fit on my wrist. Btw 9x5x5 = 225, the FR225 was my first running whatch, so if this isn't a sign... ;)
I deserve a garmin forerunner because i am skint , and still rocking the 910xt
I deserve the new garmin fr955 because I'm a typical Scottish miser & too tight to upgrade current watch! Also away to tackle my first 24hr event, I neeeed longer battery life!
I deserve Garmin FR955 because I know that I can achieve higher results with this brand new watch. I love running and want to achieve better results in it. This watch will give me extra motivation to put more efforts in my trainings. I have my brother to whom I need to be role model. He is starting his career in tennis and I take him to running with me. With this watch we can achieve higher results
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I'm a new runner and therefore need something swanky and bling to wear at park runs- making me look like a pro to distract the others eyes from my bad running form and turtle speeds 🥴

I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I'm moving up from my usual 10k to a marathon and I'd like to track my progress
I DESERVE THE NEW FR955 BECAUSE, I’ve been using the old 920x watch for 6 years which is extremely large and lacks the necessary features of any sensible watch. It’s like having a touch screen phone, without the touch or the phone.
I deserve the fr955 because my fr645 is giving up the ghost and not having one will seriously disrupt my impetus to keep training, pushing me back to resembling the belly off the old Reebok advert from the 90’s. Also as a side note, I don’t look anything like Jacques Villeneuve unlike the guy in the video!
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because ..... I like the smell of freshly open instructions but I don't really like reading them. And seriously, I try to go back to running after a very long break and Forerunner 60 who accompanied me he gave up to the test of time he wos good companion, and I would be very useful to me a new watch, I would find out how all these goodies works The most stress assessment may explain my hair loss and to make it look cool on my maej hand like a compass
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because… I’m planning to attempt an Everesting challenge! 🚴‍♂️

I deserve a FR955 as we've just had our second child and those 6am & 10pm runs are taking all the discipline in the world to fit in but i'm doing it.

I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because it will look awesome on my wrist when I complete my first full Ironman in August. I mean looking good is half the battle right???
No seriously I am a dedicated and loyal Garmin fan and my older model is getting a bit sorry for itself now. 😢
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because I'll make sure to clean the touch screen.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I really like the new features of the watch
I like to have a watch like this because i cannot afford  to buy this wonderful watch with lots of features that can help me with my dealy  life.

I deserve a FR955 because it will help me train to have a Triathlon as good as my first. Well let's be honest it won't help me train any harder it might just make me think I look cooler doing it.
The watch could be useful for my  niece who's training hard to be part of the Philippine Triathlon team. She only borrows the watch of her dad when she goes training. Winning this watch could mean a big help for her cause she could monitor her activities. I do hope I win this watch....for my niece,the current Visayan triathlon champ under 14yrs old, Visayas Philippines. Thanka
I deserve a FR955 because I need to charge my current cr*ppy Chinese-brand watch with a stripped USB cable that tends to give me low-voltage snaps that I guess are workout reminders... Would love to have the gentle Morning report with polite workout suggestions from FR955.

I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I'm a keen triathlete too and  don't want Gabs to have an unfair advantage 🙃
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because my 10 year old 910 has just died. Proof Garmins last almost forever.

I deserve the Garmin FR955 because of my three rules. 
Rule 1: Always look good.

With a Garmin FR955, I'll be able to follow all the rules finally.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because      I am from South-Africa😂😂, I need serious motivation. I had the same 🍏 watch for the past 4 years i wanted to upgrade to the Garmin ever since. I started running about 2 years ago after being a swimmer for more than 20years. Recently I started cycling also on the side. I need a new sports watch!!!
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because when I run I often look  forlornly at my empty unstylish wrist, which doesn’t show any HR details, phone notifications or running pace/time. My wrist does seem to solar charge though, it’s full when it’s red and peeling, ouch! Please help my poor wrist out with an ace new watch, pretty please 🙏 🥺

Has a winner been chosen? I see you have asked someone to contact you
i deserve a FR955 as im trying to get fit again after covid and theres no better way to keep me on track
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because, being a slow running, I've been making all the faster runners look good for years (you're all welcome 😉)
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because my wife gifted me the Fenix 7 and I’d like to gift this to her for our 10th wedding anniversary.
Late usual but I deserve the watch cause as I age (42) I have one great adventure left in me.. I'm training for an ironman and this bad boy here will be the thing that get me there. And that might my last chance to impress the ladies.
I deserve the new Garmin fr955 because
G - Great design
A - add to the collection

M - my wife would be jelous
I - im due a new one 
N - now, gimme!! 🤣🤣
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I kept going over the wrong bridge in Norwich without maps on my watch.
I deserve the new Garmin ForeRunner 955 because I never want a repeat of the missed KOM of a park run in 2012 due to the battery running out. Probably would of made the Farnham gazette if that segment had registered. Hey ho. Paul
I deserve, or at least, would certainly appreciate the Garmin FR955 as an aid in my epic quest to slay my body and maximize my performance capability in everything from your normal 5K, to sports, to slaying dragons; the usual. I ruptured my achillies doing one of these 3 activities a couple years back and though my performance has drastically improved on my own, I've seemed to plateau in some areas, especially while I'm wearing my suit of armor, because dragons and what not. Thank you for reading; no dragons were harmed in the making of this comment. Have a brilliant day.
21 day battery life!!!! That’s crazy!!! I need to win it please!! 😊
I deserve a FR955 because it will look better on my wrist when I wear a suit than my Fenix 6 Pro
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because I would like to increase my fitness to the next level.
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because I CANNOT afford to be doing any unnecessary miles in my first ultra (Lakeland 50) 😬😬
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I am in the middle of planning my wedding and can’t afford to spend any money until after the big day.
I deserve a FR955 because I know it will motivate me more to hit the streets having an awesome watch like this.. Please choose me I’ll never have the means to buy something this expensive for myself
I deserve the garmin fr995 because I work day in day out and still can’t get the money together to get one 😂
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because when I went out running early morning (still dark) with a watch without a map/navigation function I ended up getting lost and running down a narrow trail in the pitch dark and I couldn't find my way.  I bumped into a pig style (literally) and disturb a mum pig with her piglets, scare the !?$* out of both her and me as she came running out to investigate.  I jumped the nearest fenced into some stingers only to find the path and style I should have been on, if only I'd had the new Garmin FR955 to guide me.
I deserve a FR955 because...
I. Hate. Running. But I have also promise myself that I can/will/"need" to run 10k under an hour. This because I need a better health and to get more energy to play with childrens. 
(In the process to find a running watch for me, stand between 955 and 255)
I deserve it, because i training every day!
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because my FR245 battery is way to small for the Ultras I run and I have to charge during the run :(
i deserve the new garmin forerunner 955 because i need need replacement for my old suunto watch for runninh/multi sports
I deserve the Garmin FR955 so that my family can keep track of me and I can keep track of me especially off road
I deserve a FR955 because Im too broke to buy one myself. l don't know why I torture myself watching these videos if I'm not going to buy one myself 😂.
I deserve the the new Garmin FR955 because my Vivoactive 4 is not triathlon ready, and the touchscreen allow an easy migration, as well as let me use the maps, after I get lost, again.....
I deserve a Garmin 945 because I just behaved those days ! 😇
I deserve the new Garmin FR955, because It’s almost my birthday and I want to make it impossible for my wife to find a better gift!
I deserve a new Garmin FR955 so that I can use the tracking feature. Not so that my husband can feel safe knowing where I am when I'm out on the trails. Mostly so that he can safely get himself coffee☕ and cake🎂 and not have to panic about missing me pass him when running races🏃🏻‍♀️. He claims that spectating (especially for marathons or ironman events) is a harder day than the actual competing 🤷🏻‍♀️ this might reduce him moaning about it 😂
I deserve a FR955 because i do plenty of run/drawing and some of them over  hours duration. best
I deserve a new Forerunner 955 because my best running buddy needs a new watch
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because my Garmin FR920xt spends most the time displaying 00:00. I wish i was joking. My partner keeps telling. My partner wants me to upgrade as it frustrates her. I torn because I’ve had so many great adventures with the 920xt. The 955 looks like a worthy replacement:)
I think I deserve a Garmin 955 because I've been using my Fenix 5s for a long time and the watch is gettin kinda slow now and I do not have 599usd to buy a new one :)
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because…as a vitamin D deficient half-vampire, I must Wiggle in the sunshine more. Also, my built in body battery meter is broken so I desperately need one on my wrist.
I deserve a FR955 because I like running.😀
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because I really would like to have it and don't want to pay for it! :D
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I am from another planet and we don't have running watches there. FR955 will make me god of the running on my planet
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I think I can WIGGLE my arse down to sub 6min mile and not worry about bonking with the stamina widget 👊
I deserve FR955 because my wife is getting into running and wants my current FR245.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I suffer from a serious case of short course / bad GPS paranoia having been subjected to years of "short course" abuse by my club mates ever since my old Garmin watch recorded New Forest Half Marathon short by 500m. The funniest part? Garmin is the headline sponsor of the event 😉
I deserve a FR955 because I’m a bit on the ‘Tubby’ side and could do with a little more help.
I deserve a FR955 because Garmin helps me stay motivated to train even in such a hectic time! 🇺🇦❤
I am no sure if I deserve this watch more than anyone else or not really. I am not a super athlete, I don’t set records, more of a plodder just trying to get fit and needing all the help I can get!
I don’t deserve the watch… however, I will accept a mug 👍🧡
I deserve a FR955 because...

No really I deserve to win because I am on transformation journey to lose an additional 150# and could really use a tool like this to motivate and help me!
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 as I need all the data I can get to boost my morale as I get older and slower. A message mid morning to say that I'm really lacking energy will be great. I really will feel like I'm Marvin the paranoid android (I told you I was old, you are too if you get the reference🤣). In races not only will I have calculated my own target time, I will have a second prediction from Garmin. Both of which I will then miss, to make me feel really rubbish on the finish line, as I'm dying from exhaustion and reflecting on all those mid morning messages telling me I'm not very fit today. If then when I'm home I can go onto garmin connect and study in detail all the data in detail, including HVR, I can go to bed, worrying that my number is nearly up, comfortably stressed to guarantee my mid morning report won't make good reading. On the plus side I would be able to fill the watch with songs from The Smiths/Morrissey to feel really uplifted again. Heaven knows I'm miserable now...... But I do love a gadget, so it may help to lift my mood 🤣🤣🤣
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I respect my body and want best on my wrist...💕
I deserve to win the FR955 because I am just one watch away on my arm from being legally locked up as an insane garmin geek when I go for runs, now standing at 3 watches per run. Wiggle me!
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I forget to charge it and the solar charging will help with that!
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because my Ironman pace is so slow I need a watch that can last and I didn’t get any haricot in my last order.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because...... Well, I just do don't I, although no more deserving than anyone else here, hmmmm...... well perhaps a little bit more, I don't know. Will it help me to be more decisive? Love my FR245, but an upgrade would be magic 😃
I deserve a FR955 because I'm the first to comment on this!
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I use an old Tomtom running watch for the last 8 years and it is slowly dying ^^
I deserve a fr955 because i want it!))
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because i crashed into a deer with my road bike and my FR945 are scratched. 🦌
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I’ve been a good husband but my wife will never ever let me buy it without selling my soul… so this is the only way I have to get it. Please wiggle, I beg you 😂
I deserve a FR955 because I am trying to become the fitness and fastest I can.
I deserve a FR955 because 🎶 I like to Move It Move It 🎶
I deserve a FR955 because my budgeting software says I can't buy this watch.

I deserve the Forerunner 955
because….. I don't know what time it is 😫
I deserve a FR955 so I can give my 745 to my good mate!
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because I have a lot of sun in my city
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because who doesn’t love opening a shiny new box and reading all the wee books it comes with. Would also be great recording all my runs as I aim for 1000 days nonstop running. #solarrunningjunkie
I deserve the fr955 because... I noticed that at minute 16 of the video the audio is lost ☹️
I deserve the garment FR955 because my phone is keeping me back while recording my runs🤭
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I desperately need the brilliant multiband gps. The last time I went out on a trail, I got so lost that I came back looking like the Tom Hanks character from Cast Away and have taken to running with a packet of ginger nuts in my pocket so I can leave a trail in order in find a way home. A new FR955 will help me to run without an annoying rustling noise and from being followed by slightly covetous small mammals. Please help.
I deserve a garmin watch because I will use the hell out of it
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because my border terrier tw#t puppy chewed up my Garmin forerunner 45.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I'm extremly motivated to get the best out of me.
I DESERVE THE GARMIN FR955 BECAUSE…. having one would give me extra justification for getting out on the bike/on a run when I need that extra excuse! Plus. Think of all the data it would give me!
I deserve the new Garmin Freerunner 955 because like me, me current one is old and clapped out and needs an update. I record my bike rides on my Garmin Edge Explore but walks: forget it. Anyone would think I spent the days in between rides doing nothing!
I deserve a FR99 to improve my 5k time as the wife said I spend too much time running.
I deseve the new Garmin FR955 because I don’t have a garmin watch
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 so I can gift it to my fiancée Ellie so that she can start running and cycling and I can have a permanent training buddy!
I deserve the new FR955 because lately I am super lazy and believe a new gadget might turn things around.(???)
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because i have 3 kids and training keeps me sharp😅🤣
I would love to win this watch so I can lay to rest this well used Garmin 920xt... RIP 920xt ✊✊
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because  I’m finally starting to explore the trails in Somerset and my FR235 is showing it’s age 👴🏻
I deserve a FR955 so that I can have all the gear and no idea
Dont forget that garmin refuses to do any repairs so they will offer you 40% on the same model (which is 20% compared to price in other stores). In that moment, it could be 5 year old model. My garmin stopped working few months after guarantee expired and they offered me that 20% discount on 3 year old model and told me thats the only thing they can do. Too bad
I deserve the garmin Fr955 because im garmin user for 20 plis years and run everyday
I DESERVE THE GARMIN FR955 BECAUSE I LOVE WIGGLE ❤️ & I NEED A NEW WATCH ❤️ 😊
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I have an addiction to shiny things and more shiny things is the only treatment…
I deserve a Garmin FR955 because... it would be awesome to own a casual 'black magic' (vid 1:24) to have a top of the range product to add the secret potion to my running and make me fall in love with racing and hopefully give me the spell to improve my training that won't be broken for a very long time . Plus I promise I will add the #littlemix song to my running playlist 😂😂
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because i make sports for healty thats why i need check my heart beats 😁✌️
While I wouldn't say deserve it, I'd like for you to gift me this forerunner 955 please because I'm training to go to BUDS and become a Navy SEAL. I had hip surgery 2 years ago to the day come June 20th and having to learn to walk/ run properly again was quite the undertaking. My training have been quite tumultuous with having lost 60lbs once healed from surgery to having COVID-19 three times it's been rough saying consistent but I've endured for my dream. At 29 my years old I'll need an age waiver and to wow them with amazing physical screening scores so I'd appreciate ever edge I can get. I've tried The Samsung active 2, the Polar Grit X and the Garmin Venu all without luck so I'm hoping this forerunner 955 will take my training to the next level. I see my recruiter in September so I'd really appreciate the support and gift. Thanks for you time and have a great day Sir!
I deserve the Garmin 955 because I need it for my Ironman events and my Apple watch is not cutting it for me.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because then I will win even the fastest runners in the discipline of the best running watch.
I deserve FR955 because... Because. Ok i cant remember now why but deserrrrve it 😁
I deserve the new Garmin fr955 because I need a " triathlon " button in my life .
I deserve the new Garmin FR955, if I am selected as the winner of this competition.
I deserve the Garmin Forerunner 955 as I LOVE ALL THINGS GARMIN. With the 955 I can finally divorce my phone (temporarily) and train in uninterrupted bliss.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I... dint know... just i want
I do love Run but never have Garmin..
I deserve a forerunner 955 because I am the least dench running dad –with a spectacular dad bod– out there. If anyone needed a solar boost, it's me. Last time I saw the sunshine was in 2019 and that holiday got rained off by a literal hurricane. Scrap the running watch, can you give me a beach holiday and a gym membership instead* 


*(I would actually really like this watch, pls send)
I deserve to win the new garmin forerunner 955 because looking cool will obviously make me faster!
Whaaaaat watch face is this?? Is this just the standard watch face without the ‘arms’ ? Think I asked that right lol.
I deserve the FR955 because a want this super watch to record all my pickleball activities 😂
I deserve a garmin forerunner 955 because I cycled into a pot whole and fell into a bush on a gravel ride, in the process breaking my older forerunner.
I deserve a FR955 because... wait, no I don't really deserve one. 🤔  I've been really lazy with exercise my whole life and never put in the effort I should, or worse, I over exert myself - which just ends up with me giving up.  I suppose having a watch that could tell me when to rest and when to push myself would help with that... and having the ability to track my progress would actually help keep me motivated without wearing myself out...  So just forget all that stuff... I deserve one... well, I want one.  Pick me! :-)
I deserve the 955 because penguins are my nemesis.
I deserve a FR955 because my hair is neater than his and I haven't got any :)
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I wiggle it, just a little bit.
I hope i deserve Garmin 955, because i have gray hair and nede to get running😅
I deserve a FR955 because I am sick of getting my phone out to navigate routes every 10 minutes
Send me Garmz 955 Wigz.. wanna up my running game. Gotta lose dem layers.
I deserve a FR955 because I run a lot :)
I deserve a FR955 because my wife by the morning wold say OK, then by the evening she would ask me if I bought it and its only at night when we go to bed, she just turn over to the other side of the bed and say nothing for the whole week!!! 😥
Crap that doesn't last. Bluetooth stopped working after about 6 months so now it can't sync with my phone. Tried to get help from Gramin but only get new sets of instructions that won't work. Feels like they´re trying to avoid a repair/replacement by exhausting me. Very disappointed, especially given the price....
I think I deserve this Garmin FR995 as the training readiness widget will back me up if I'm feeling plod ploddy and the stamina widget will give me confidence to put more welly into a race when unsure if enough energy in the bank . These features and all the others look so interesting.
I think I deserve a  Garmin 955 as I have no watch
I deserve a FR955 because garmin does not upgrading my 935! Which sucks! Cheers guys.
I  deserve the new garmin fr955 because if I didn’t record my run and post it on strava I did not happen !
I deserve this watch because I just do 🙂
I deseve this new Garmin watch as I'm a UFFF yes I'm an un fit fat fella. And to make it even worst I'm 56🙄 hey but here's hoping that this little beauty will help me get of my ass and monitor my HR whilst I try and slog a few Ks out on my bike or pound the roads ( in the dark😂). So if you had any conscience  you'd help! 

I probably won't win anyways so thanks for help save my knees👍😳😜
I get the "I deserve the new Garmin..." intention but I'll first say I don't deserve it. I'm wearing a 945 and watching the video on a decent smartphone from an air conditioned room. I'd rather see the watch auctioned with proceeds given to charity. Or perhaps given to a disabled athlete or veteran trying to regain fitness. Just my. 02
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I’m going to be a first time daddy next month (early July) and gotta save some bucks for diapers.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because the sun's trying to kill me
I deserve a FR955 because I’m 36, overweight and clinging on to the “I used to be a runner”. 
At 16 I ran 29mins for 5 miles (before GPS watches were a thing) 
Ran 1hr 28mins in 2008 at the Great North Run in a “comeback” and
18:46 in a 2012 Parkrun as I was motivated to be healthy for my wedding that year.

Now in 2022 I have a desk job, after being made redundant through the pandemic, that has contributed to increasing my waistline (15 stone!!!!) 
A family man with a 8 year old daughter who I want to inspire, a wife who is 20 weeks pregnant and lost my mum mid-April. 
If I was to win the watch I would use the Music On My Wrist feature, to increase my time on feet through podcasts and playlists, the Daily Suggested Workouts facility to schedule training sessions based on my race calendar and report back to Wiggle HQ regularly my journey from “fat to fit”.
Give me the watch and 12-18 months to watch me go from my first run with it to a sub 18min 5km, sub 1:25 half marathon and a sub 3hr marathon 🏃🏻‍♂️
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because my new Forerunner 45 was stolen by my ex, just before she ran away with a professional triathlete.
I deserve the Garmin FR955 because I’m a fat 40 year old who’s just signed up to the Leeds marathon next year and need all the help I can get!
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I am a tight old git that won’t upgrade my Forerunner 745.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because i brought helium instead of air!
I deserve the brand new Garmin Forerunner 955, because I’m  financial ruined by our totalitarian government, by their so called COVID restrictions. They entirely deleted all my plans and opportunities for starting my dream in beginning of 2020.  I’m a runner, a biker and a swimmer who really needs a great watch to  accompany me with my outdoor training . Have a nice day and regards, Bertwin
I deserve the new FR955 because… my wife booked me on to a surprise half Ironman in September as a birthday present and wrote in the card “Happy Birthday - you’re getting fat”
I deserve a garmin forerunner to help keep my training on track for my first ironman. The accuracy, body battery, sleep data, stress score and performance metrics will make sure I'm training and recovering efficiently. The extended battery from the solor power will keep the unit working during ultra endurance training sessions and races. The touch screen and mapping might actually stop me getting lost.
I deserve a FR955 because the wristband of my current garmin broke again and I am too cheapskate to buy a new band.
I deserve the new garmin forerunner 955 because I am running the Thames path 100k for charity. My current garmin 245 battery won’t last :)
I deserve the new garmin fr955 because…whatever reason you think! 😂🤞
I deserve the FR455 because I don’t have a watch.
I deserve forerunner 955, so I can log on weight loss from 244 to 200 in 30 days.

I deserve a Garmin FR955 because I am a wanna be ultra runner and I lose every online giveaway <3
I deserve the garmin FR955 because who doesn't want as much "evidence" to back up excuses when they get beaten!?
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because i just got punched in the arm for getting caught out in the circle game!!
I deserve a Garmin FR955 Solar because my dog told me that I'm a good boy.
I deserve a new Garmin Forerunner 955 because I love ALL THINGS GARMIN. With the 955 I can finally divorce (temporarily) my phone and train in uninterrupted bliss.
I deserve a FR955 because I've only got a 6 year old Garmin 235 :(
I deserve the Garmin fr955 because I look like a caveman using my dad's old forerunner 305 and it's time it got it's well earned retirement 🎉
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I need Wiggle to help me lose my jiggle. I am getting married next year and I am certain that this watch would give me the incentive to get me out training more regularly so I can lose my Ned Kelly. I always love seeing Christian Slater working with Wiggle 🏃
Сподіваюсь, Garmin FR955 реально кращий за попередні версії. Бо я повернувся до телефона
I deserve the garmin Fr955 because…(what ever reason you think)

Edit: on a serious note, I wanna feel lucky

i deserve the garmin fr955 because.... I'm hard working, data driven and mid-way to my ironman kona world championship 5 year plan. This piece of equipment promises to be the first wrist computer that gets my panties rolling in the crack and my blood flowing , in the rigt places - of its promise. If I get to sell my oura ring and rid of those pesky monthly fees with this gadget.following my hrv trends and get accurate gps to my full day adventure workouts - im on board!
I deserve a fr955 because my fr935 is broken
I deserve a FR955 because it's cheaper than a divorce.  That way I can enjoy the fabulous new watch - "it was free; I won it in a competition" - without having to explain to my wife why my current Forerunner 945 is not good enough.
I deserve a FR955 because I need to track all the dog walks I have with my girlfriend.

I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because Apple watch sux :)
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because......flaps.
WOW how can this be the best running watch 2022, so much money for so little. Love Garmin not liking dated tech for premium orice.
I deserve the new Garmin FR955 because I can then see how shockingly my dad-bod transformation is going whilst looking like a haggard version of the guy in the video pushing a double running buggy…help a brother out
I deserve a FR955 because...
I think I deserve a Garmin 955 as I've been using my digital casino watch for the last 3 years for all my training! Which basically means I can just time my runs laughing 🤣
I deserve a FR955 because I am obese and wake up at 955 and that needs to stop :D
That charging cable. Urghhhh
I think the fact you have to wear a strap to record your HR is a massive downfall and an extra expense!
I deserve ForeRunner 995 because I do not run
I deserve the Garmin 955 as I’m expecting my first child and I don’t wanna be a fat daddy
I server the new Garmin Forerunner 955 because the Apple Watch sucks for any sort of real training
This isn’t a review, this is a feature overview that gently kisses up to Garmin.  Find another video, maybe DCRainmaker. If a review states how well a feature works without actually having tested it, you know they’re just reading marketing copy.
I deserve  the watch because I am poor and all I  have  is a  phone 📱
I don't deserve this watch 👍
I deserve the new Garmin Forerunner 955 because dot dot dot, I’m awesome and would be awesomer with this new #garmin product.
My dog is awesome too, at least he was until he chewed my old one.

I DESERVE THE GARMIN FR955 BECAUSE I WILL SEND IT TO UKRAINIAN RUNNER🇺🇦
She’s wearing Hoka’s, I can’t listen, sorry
I DESERVE THE GARMIN FR955 BECAUSE... my electric bill has gone up, and the solar function will help during the summer months when it comes to charging. #Everylittlehelps

... and it looks class!
I got the 55 about 4 months ago. Super comfy to wear all day everyday. It has all the features I need and great battery life. I was looking at more expensive models, but am glad this is the one I chose. No problems to report so far.
I couldn't be happier with this watch...nice review
Nice one Ryan! The 55 is one of my favorites for beginners on a budget!
Helpful!
Just ordered one up for my wife’s first running watch 👍🏻
I just got my forerunner 55 last Monday and im happy with it. I use it as a smart watch and step tracker.
Unfortunate they left out trail running. Will be looking forward to the Garmin 245 review. Thanks for taking the time to make these videos.
Double the battery life of the 45!  Such a good option.  Works fine for swimming and cycling.  It doesn't connect to all of the cycling toys but it's fine for the basics.  Your video reviews are so damn good.   Keep it up buddy!
Hi, thanks for the report. Can you tell me if the Garmin 55 (GPS) is effective in a trail with trees on the both side?
Great review, thanks.

I bought a Forerunner 55 about a week ago to replace my old Polar M400........and I am seriously impressed by it for an entry level watch. I'm no stranger to Garmin products, having owned three of their cycling computers. My experiences with them gave me great confidence that I wouldn't be disappointed with the 55.....and I was right. 

Learned a couple of tips from your video, so will be applying those in the future. Thanks again.
Can you see your VO2max with this?
Hi! which watch do you prefer between the garmin forerunner 55 and the garmin Venu Sq to start with?
Hey Ryan, looks great I see some deals on it. How would you say it compares to other mid range Garmins say the Vivoactive 4?
I’m looking for my first gps running on a budget. Should I get the original instinct over this watch at the same price?
Ultra marathoners have my respect, I strive to be one.
After 3.5 years, my Polar Vantage V battery suddenly drained. It pushed me to decide to either renew a battery or buy a watch. After seeing the price and function of F55, I decided to return to Garmin running society. I was surprised by the functions of F55 but disappointed for Polar V. If the battery of F55 could survive for 4 years and be renewable, that would be great. It the rechargeable battery cannot run more than 4 years, I thought it was not an environment friendly product.
I just got this, my first proper running watch. VERY disappointed in the pace reading. It's all over the place! One moment I'm running at 8:55 pace, the next, 9:50, the next, 11:20 and so on. I'm used to using the Runkeeper app on my phone which has an *average pace* option which is consistent. This phone doesn't seem to have that, it only seems to have *current pace* . Can anybody help with a suggestion about this please? It's really frustrating, thanks. BTW, nice review, liked and subbed .
What version of the watch do they have but without GPS? Cause I don't need it, I don't think I need it
I’m sold!
I'm torn between this and the 245, I'm new to running and I'd use it mainly for running, hiking and going to the gym. Also fitness tracking. Which one would you recommend? The 55 is about £60 cheaper.
Hello sir,I have Samsung galaxy watch 3 but now planning to buy Garmin 55 for Garmin coach and pacepro.Should I ?
Love from India
Will this work as a health tracker and for rucking?
My Garmin Instinct has horrible issues with the wrist HR monitor. It’s got updated software, so it’s probably a hardware issue. Otherwise it’s great for a hiker/trail runner like me.
Can we record the data in Garmin Forerunner 55 without carrying a smartphone?
Since they are the same price now on sale should I get the 245 or 55?
can you use this for cycling?
hey man could u pls suggest a genuine site where i can get a 55 on discount ?
does it do navigation?

Are you thinking of buying a Garmin Forerunner 45 in 2022? What's the best price/deal in your region or what price have you paid recently?
Bought the same watch from the same seller and I’m very happy so far. Replaced my old TomTom which was no longer supported and had become very slow, this is a much more advanced and usable watch. Currently on week 2 of the on board 1/2 marathon training plan, I have several nice watch faces loaded and it interfaces well with my iPhone and apps including Strava 👌👌
Nice one...amazing how few review(ers) cover the basics for someone getting one out of the box and just using it.They want to show you all the sub-menus and tweeks but forget a runner just wants to know how to use the soddin thing!
Thanks for this pal - I’m after a cheap GPS watch for running that connects to Strava and this has convinced me the 45 is the one.
Great review simple and to the point.
I guess if l do a weights session there is a setting/mode  on there for me to record the time/heart rate? 
Cheers
Nice video!!
Very good video. When cycling is there an option to switch between Ebike and normal bike
Very helpful, thanks. When the device transfers the data through to Strava does it publish it automatically on there or do you need then to access strava, give it a name etc and publish manually?
Got a question . Can you display gpx maps for trail run on this watch?
Hi. Thanks for the video.  How long will the battery last whilst tracking my emb ride?  We are often out for 4 hours plus.
Thanks.
Nice!
I just bought one of these and wanted to check if I had made a bad decision or not
Does the watch display elevation gain for bike rides?
Hey, great review! Was just wondering if the strava activity will also include a map of where you've been.
Does it count steps if you shake your wrist up and down very quickly for about 10 seconds even if you are sitting on a chair?
Awesome review MergeDroid. Very helpful.
Sorry in advance for my weak english.
Quick question how do I connect my Garmin 45 to strava.
Long back ago I made an account on strava app on my phone. And it didn't ask me to create password that time and I was using it smoothly. Whenever I go for run I take my phone with me and publish data after done with activity.
 Now I am planning to buy 45 and I am confused if I sync it with my stava account through Garmin connect app it will ask for strava password which I haven't created then, how  will I able to sync all my activity datas to strava. And I don't want to create new strava account coz I will lose 2 years of my running and cycling datas.
Please help
Thanks in advance.
Is the vibration strength good?
Hey! If I want to connect Garmin cycling speed and cadence sensor to this watch would it connect easily?
Still that refinished watch available?
If i recorded my ride using bike comp (not garmin) which sync with my strava, will it be sync to garmin apps through strava?
Does it automatically track a walk?  As an exercise, say walking a dog?  If you don’t have GPS  turned on I’m assuming it won’t show a map if it uploads to Strava?  Is the forerunner 55 better?  Or what do you recommend for walking?
Hi, when my running activity (recorded with the Garmin Forerunner 45) is uploaded to Strava, it does not show any map of where exactly I ran. Is this just not possible with this Garmin, or is it a setting I have to change?
Can you connect wireless headphones and listen to music
Does it have sleep tracking feature?
does this work in remote places without internet network connection?
I am thinkin about that one... I am using Tom Tom Runner which i bought 6 years ago and still works very good.... But this Garmin is looking so good... In my city price is. 135usd
I have returned mine twice as the background colour is purple and not black.   In instances where the background is white the writing is purple instead of black .
Does the watch work for running and calculating mileage without a phone?
I got mine 3 days ago and I've had to charge it twice. I'm thinking of returning it
hi, how does the 235 compare to the 45
Do I need to Run with my phone to save my time on strava? or can i run with ONLY The Garmin Forerunner 45, and save the strava time after the run from my watch to phone strava app? IF so i need to buy The Garmin Forerunner 45. ( I want a watch were i only need the watch when i run and save progress after on strava)
How do I respond to text msgs?
Just bought one, hope it's going to work out well. 4 year old device, I've got my doubts but the reality is i just don't know what to expect from a real quality brand, amazfit was disappointing.
i dont use a phone can the 45 be used alone?
Really informative video, I am awaiting the harming from same eBay seller, apologies I bought prior to watching your video
Can you swim with it?
Can I swim with this watch?
Gg
I would say that the biggest deciding factor is your budget
I am a sales rep at a lbs, this video is helpful and pertinent as the plethora of devices and features continuously expands. This content is essential for helping me meet riders' needs as well as my own.
Thank you for clarifying my decision-making process dude my head was spinning after researching by computers.😊
The big advantage of Garmin Devices is, you are allowed to use third party maps like Velomap to navigate.
Will it be worth the 530 in 2023? Or is it worth waiting for the release Edge 540?
You did an outstanding job on presenting the various options and capabilities of the Garmin units.  I am in my late 60s…healthy, fit and active.  I’ve always loved bicycling…and in retirement, I’ve developed an interest in “gravel tour bikepacking”.  As I spent two careers in challenging (and often fraught with danger) professions (military and federal law enforcement), I have no wish to entertain unnecessary danger in my recreation.  I have had too many close calls with vehicles on the road (too many damned drivers staring at screens, I would guess!  Funny, as how this video is presenting a “screen” to bicyclists).  Anyway, my question, I know that you can “front load” a route in some devices…what I’m looking for is a bike computer that can depict “off pavement” routing. So, let’s say, I want to ride my bike across Massachusetts, Outskirts of Boston to Stockbridge…I want to avoid paved roads to greatest extent possible.  Do I have to know those gravel roads, rail trails, twin track roads?  Or is there a device that I front load my parameters, and input origin and destination?  Again, you did a great job of explaining….I’m just looking for greater detail how a particular unit will perform.  Thanks again!  Bravo-Zulu, very well done!
Hello I have a question I use the Garmin 1000, but i dropped it now the screen looks fun. I might be looking to go another 1 what would you recommend. I ride road about 3 times a week 30+ miles
Anyone using Edge 130 or 130 plus as an extended display for Garmin Fenix? Because it does not use GPS and connect to many sensors as a normal use, I wonder how long its battery is going to last for more than 12 hours claimed or not?
Need edge 140 with usb-c and climbpro
Thanks
Would like to see the 130 get an update that allows Di2 compatibility. Don't much care for anything else like climb pro.
My main concern with garmin edge 530 is how bad the navigation is. Once you started the course you can't modify it. When you get off course navigation won't guide you back on course. Is there any upgrade that fixes these problems?
durability is higher with phone with special cases
Can we change the map region? For example, from the South East Asia map to United States or Europe. Thanks
Do you have to pay any subscription to use the GPS ?
I need reading glasses, this puts me off from investing in one.
Carmín is the Nokia of the cycling world. How about updating the app and interface with features like wahoo to be able to load a route on demand? Btw on my edge 530 the screen died I opened the device and it was just a lose connector. Really poor Garmin.
using edge and fenix for years,....but waiting for when the maps will show up for india...!!
just open the API for 3rd parties mappers people...!!
"Battery 🔋 life continues to improve year after year" <- 🤣 you obviously didn't live through the 90's and early 2000's.
Nice good tho.
Thanks
I got jumpscared when I saw the prices of these. 
Used is an option, but I’ll still go with my old phone. Heavier and less battery. I’ll keep using sound navigation and turning the screen on when needed.
I have a garmin epix 2.0. Do you think it is worth it to get a cycling computer as well? Or can I download and display the route on my watch?
I got the forerunner 945 and it's been great! Lightweight and has most of the best features 👍
it was fun seeing Mike on the street in Chamonix. welcome back bro. I bought the enduro2 the same day I met you in Chamonix. love it.
love your video!!! all Garmin watch comparison videos I found are talking about colors of the watches and bands...so irrelevant....everything in your video is super relevant and I am really impressed you can do such in depth analysis about them all! :O really big thank you! <3
I intend to get the 955. I especially want the multiband gps. I race a fair bit and in some places where the distance and pace can be off - I hate it when I go out too hard thinking I’m not going fast enough, or thinking I’m on pace and then missing my target time.
I love the Epix, so far its been a perfect watch for me. 👍
Great video. Well done
Loved my 735, just upgraded to the 745 and it's had a lot of features added. Good list guys 👍
22:14 I like the FLEX on this one 😄
Had my 245 since release day.  2023. Still my Everyday Carry.
I sold 245 to buy f6s for lactate threshold test and ability to dim backlight lol. But other the those two things 245 is incredible good watch.
bought a FR 255 on ebay used, but bought on 19.07.23. So I got a nearly new FR 255 for 245€ (250€ with shipping). Good enough for me.
Really good video guys. I have a Suunto 5, which I think is a good all-rounder, but am ramping up my running in preparation for a HM in the spring. Just picked up a 245, on an Amazon deal, for £140. It feels a bit plasticky compared to the Suunto, and was considering stepping up to the Fenix 6 (£270) and I’d have to try & move on the Suunto. So…on the back of this video, I think I’ll keep the 245 as a dedicated run watch, and use the Suunto for hikes etc.
I was just thinking last night what’s the best running watch for my needs? Mine is getting long in the tooth and it’s time for a new one as I return to running from an injury. 😀😎😀
Which of the entry level watches can u add running pod for running analysis
I have a Garmin Fr 245 Music, (I don’t use the music now when i’m running). I’m thinking on update for the 955, Fenix 7 or Enduro 2. And now i’m doubt with Epix 2. First problem, money. I have the money but I’m not sure if is really necessary a watch too much expensive. I think finally don’t change my watch and when my fr245M died. I will buy other. Lol
I have a 245 and it's great, but i'm watching this thinking do i need a 955 or Fenix 7?.. Probably not but it's tempting!
Hi, can you tell me where I can buy epix for the price you put up on screen please ?
I got a 245 on discount and an HRM Pro - I think this combo gives me everything I need
Maybe top budget watch/smart band for runners
Forerunner 255 vs venu 2 plus. Which one would you suggest?
Great overview, thanks. Many of us are getting a bit older and now use readers, so seeing distance is fine but reading/glancing at fine print like the watch face while we're actually running is hard to do. 
Aren't there any accessibility features like larger fonts on the Garmin watches (like my Fenix 6)? 
For example, I could live with a limited screen with only time, heart rate and distance but in larger fonts.
I’m looking an upgrading from apple to garmin can you use apps like Nike Run Club on garmin watches as I’m doing a marathon training plan on nrc
Been looking at upgrading my Fenix 5X. Got the wife the Fenix 7S solar and she loves it. Km looking at the Epix 2 but wondering with not being I a rush of there's good odds there will be a mid cycle refresh in their usual January announcements.
5:28 about Vivoactive 4 is misleading  , the watch may work with external sensors but it will receive heart rate only , and not running dynamics
I am surprised no Fenix 6 with all the latest updates it just received
I just want a better solution for zone training with hr strap than the iphone… most of the tracking means nothing to me🤣
The thing that still stops me getting a Garmin (or anything other than an Apple Watch) is the lack of Audible support. As someone who mostly runs listening to audiobooks this means I’d have to take my phone which is a deal breaker for me 😢
Guys, there's a ton of great info for us here.  Could you present a bit more slowly so we / maybe just me 🤔 can take it in please.  😆 thank you 😏🙄
The question I have - is extra 300 euro worth for Epix 2 vs 955? I mean the screen is nice but is it extra 300 nice?
Dam…. That 73 vo2 max score 🫡
Has anyone had major GPS issues with the garmin fenix 6 x pro? (Great watch but have to use it with my stryd pod for accuracy)
I recently got the 245 as a replacement for the vivoactive 3 (wanted the extra buttons). The bezel on the 55 was just too thick and it's only slightly cheaper, and the 255 is 140 euro more than the 245.
Surprised by your comments about the Fenix 6 Pro.  The GPS really isn’t that poor, I get the sense you’re a little obsessed with this…for most runners it more than performs on the fenix 6.  Also Garmin have a great rep with continued software upgrades on older models.  Finally, you can pick up the fenix 6 pro for as little as £300 now…for half the price of the 7, it’s well worth it.
Which set of watches do both of you use personally?
255 best watch by far
At 26:50, your wrist looks rather wooden.  You might want to consult your Dr.  Great comparison!  What features do you think Garmin will add to the Epix 3?
Fancy a Garmin Marq Athlete?
Seems like a discussion about the whole Garmin range, not enough strong recommendations in my opinion
Did I hear that fella say he now runs 100k A WEEK!!!??? 😱🤯😱🤯....
I still don’t know why oh why I get an Apple Watch I’m eager to sell it and get my Garmin Fenix seven
I've since done a review of the Garmin Zumo XT2! That's here: https://youtu.be/4rkP-1ImvjA
This has to be the most hilarious off-the-cuff English dry-humor motorcycle channel I have ever listened to. It’s like Hugh Grant shaved his head, grew a beard and fell in love with a motorcycle. Too awesome.
Another Zumo XT fan here. I like all the features you mentioned and when it is paired with your phone it also displays calls and messages which can be quite handy if you're out for a ride when you should be at work.
I knew civilization was finished when Mcdonalds started calling themselves a restaurant
Awesome quick wit, well explained, after a few reviews, pretty much convinced the XT is the way to roll on my adventure bike.
Keep the sunny sideup…thank you 😎
I love the dedicated Navi concept still. My old Garmin was solid and never had issues with signal.  Great review!
Ive been searching for reviews and this way the best ive found, good work
I enjoyed the fly on your head in the first segment, nice video, learned a bit.
Just watched your review I couldn’t stop chuckling I do love your humour anyway you’ve convinced me I’m going for the Garmin XT.🤘🤘
Hi Tim, just happened across this video. I'm with you on the phone in the pocket and dedicated GPS on the bike. Have a garmin Montana which I've had for around 3yrs now that has served me well. Looking to upgrade to the Zumo XT for the bigger screen ( got old ) and this review has sold it for me. Love your outlook and humour now liked and subscribed to your channel 👍
Just bought a Zumo XT for my KTM. Also subscribed to My Ride basic whilst waiting to have it fitted to the bike. Your review has convinced me that I've done the right thing. Thanks...
This was all I needed to finalize my purchase decision. Thanks a lot for the great video and perfectly clear information.
I’ve had mine for over a year and didn’t know it did any of that😂
Excellent vid again. Thanks
Got the Zumo and agree with everything you say in this video. It’s a great piece of kit, love it
I randomly came across your video today and I have to say I love your humor and you will have a long-time viewer in me!
Great Video. I use my phone as primary but on trips I also take the Zumo XT. I'm in the US and traveling through the mountains, you will loose cell signal. We nearly ran out of gas and had trouble finding a gas station. After that, I purchased the Zumo as a backup. I will use it to import map files for pre-planned routes but I really don't use it to it's full potential. Thank you for the reminder of it's other features. Weather is a big one.
Clear and reasonable analysis. Thanks buddy. Cheers from Brazil.
Good honest review, and comparison. Subscribed, looking forward to seeing more.
I appreciate the review, thank You! I agree!
Excellent! Fantastic review; love the humor. Keep them coming!
I had to stop partway through, this is comedy genius, loving it!

Now, back to the video!
I also have/use a Garmin XT and love it!  I know, old tech compared to a modern smartphone, but the reasons you mention are all relevant and real.  I live in the Southwest of the US, and in the summer months, temperatures can be quite warm (sometimes over 40C) and I have experienced the dreaded overheating scenario with my phone, which became quite inconvenient when riding somewhere I had never been before.  Also, another “feature” of a smartphone is to automatically dim/darken the screen in certain scenarios - also happens (always) at the most inappropriate times, at least for me and my phone.  I will always have a dedicated GPS unit on my bike designed to handle the environment and activity of riding a motorbike…
Great talk about the Zumo XT as I got one  coming for Xmas :)   can't wait
Interesting review, thank you Tim. I have experience of using older Garmins on bikes and recognise that speed was definitely an issue; if you deviated from the route it expected you to take, you could be faced with further route decisions before it had caught up... My preferred navi solution on my bike for a couple of years has been a Beeline - I love the simplicity (and having my phone still in my pocket) but recognise the limitations of the system and that it is not for everyone, and not a solution if you want "proper" mapping. I am in the process now of setting up my old phone as a satnav on my bike (yes, with Quadlock) and will be interested in how that works - main driver for that is to be able to use the RallyMoto roadbook app on my bike, which needs a phone to work, but I will also undoubtedly use "normal" navi apps as well when I want a change from my Beeline, which sits alongside the phone on a Givi accessory bar.
Really good video, buddy - I am about to make the 'leap' to the XT (having used the Nav V for for years on the BMW GS) - made the move to Triumph and now need a new sat-nav.  The XT is a chunk of change, but I think your video has swung it - thank you!
thank you to sharing you thoughts.
Great balanced and informative vid thanks,I’ve ordered one👍
Great vid and love your sense of humor! Thank you.
From one Brit to another, you nailed it, mate. I'm sold.
I found when driving LGV's or delivery vans that I used my dedicated satnav for main guidance but used my phone to get postcodes for cafes, petrol stations etc. Do the same on my bike so best of both worlds.
Thank you for the review. It was very helpful, and it wasn't a boring topic at all. I purchased a Zumo XT today to mount onto my bike for the same reasons you did. It's too bad you didn't show the Topo Map and Bird's View that was in the product description. Those are features I'm really looking forward to checking out.
I’ve used Tom Tom, Garmin and Phone apps. For a road bike I think the Sat Nav is the easiest option. Do note that a Mount to lock the Garmin on the bike or to use on multiple bikes will cost just as much as Quad Lock. I ride road and trails so a phone gives me apps for both styles of riding and allows me use the app/map that’s best for the country I’m in. Overall for mixed riding and multiple bikes I think the phone wins by a small margin.
I've had many Zumos over the years, 660, 595LM, XT and now the XT2.  I've used them on the bike and the car.  Wouldn't be without one.
I have had mine on my wr250r for over a year and it keeps all my offroad routes for later use. With a another mount it clips right on to my ktm 950 with no problem and allows me to chose single track two track or black top routes.
Love it, brilliant. Thanks mate!
just returned from Mexico, used the Zumo the whole time, it was terrific .
Just to add to this very useful review, during my last winter trip to Krystallrally Norway my garmin has performed perfextly in temperatures down to -15C whilst all of my friends mobile phones and tablets gave up at -5C.
So in one hit you loosing navigation and call-for-help resources
great info there and can't go without mentioning the bike. It looks awesome!!
Just purchased one of these for my multisrada enduro 👍
Great video and really helpful. cheers Tim
Well done! Interesting Review.  And I agree with you!!
Hi, I used a Garmin 660 on my previous bike a Triumph 955i for quite while. I  covered parts of France and Spain (Picos.) Initially it struggled with the Mac but I eventually managed to get it work ok with Basecamp using an ordinary 3 button mouse ( didn't like track pad and Mac Magic Mouse.)  I created several routes on the Mac and transferred them to the old Garmin 660 with out any problem although some of the routes were a bit quirky sometimes routing down an off slip road on a motorway and then back up the on slip road. The maps are def out of date now but I still occasionally use locally if  in my wife's older car that does not have a sat nav. Great video thnx.
Funniest and most factual motorcycle reviews subscribed!!!!
I have the identical setup and find it great within its limitations. I also purchased the Touratech locking dock which allows me to leave it on the bike when its in view without some light fingered so and so making it disappear. Everyone I know whose had a quad lock has had issues from them disintegrating or disengaging......Hmmmm
Damn I loved the energy of this video so much.. subbed!
Hi Tim I'm the same I don't like my phone on my bike ... you have just convinced me to buy the zumo xt ...!! Cheers 😊
I couldn't agree more. I don,t want my phone "bouncing" on the handlebar and risking loosing it, and yes, Zumo XT might be expensive but a new "top" phone nowadays is way over that price. Also, I live in Spain and I have had some overheating problems with my phones when navigating+charging+music during my summer rides; that's what finally made me get a dedicated gps a few years ago
Just stumbled on your channel. You’re freaking hilarious. I just had the rear camera on my iPhone replaced after 40 miles of riding with it on the handlebars of my Himalayan. Now that wasn’t vibration isolated, on the other hand, I rode for 16,000 miles on the same bike and the same mount with my Motorola G6 and it didn’t have any camera problems. Now to be fair the one flaw in that phone is it couldn’t really make a phone call. Life’s about give-and-take I guess.
great review and very helpful - seriously thinking about this. what is the speedometer like - is it accurate? and does it pick up all speed traps?
After having owned a Navigon 5, Navigon 6, Zumo 550 and Zumo 595 I vowed never to own a Garmin again. I have been using TomTom Rider 550 for years now and my goodness how much simpler and better that works, and for a much lower price. Nonetheless, I think it is time that the 550 gets un update.
I'm doing a lot of research into getting a Sat Nav for my own bike. Biggest worries are battery life and of plugged in to the bike if it will kill it as I want to get a bike/dash cam too. I have see a YouTube creater put the phone under a tap and it no longer responded or changed screens because you can't lock it. The speaker and suction cup are for use while in a car or hiking as you can change the travel mode.
I definitely agree a dedicated GPS is the best option for the reasons you mentioned.  The phone is better with ‘you’ in case something happens.
And I subscribed straight after than intro 😂👍
Zumo XT for me. The larger font size is so much easier to read especially with all the vibrations.
Hi Tim - love the channel - can I ask what mount you used to mount the Garmin onto your Nav Bar - just got the Zumo and a Givi nav bar ( 12mm )  but finding a decent non cheap plastic bracket is a bit elusive - thanks and safe riding - Maf in Brighton
Yup. Agreed.
Nice review, does it cover the whole world or do you have to load different maps in it and do they charge more for those maps?
I couldn't make my mind up, on this one, having had with nightmare with a Garmin Navigator 6 and all of it's uncontrollable screen problems. I had almost decided never to buy another Garmin and just go with a phone mount.  After seeing your video my mind was changed. What swung it was being able to get £92 off by having Bennetts Insurance. I've been with them for a few years.  Just an offer I couldn't refuse!  Thank You.
Thank you for the helpfull video. But I am struggling to find ''dirt/offroad'' roads in my phone. Does this Garmin know offroad roads to travel?
Thanks for this really entertaining clip. I use Garmin XT since a while now and I am happy with it. It does a good job. I do have a QuadLock mount as well for my phone, but I am actually not sure why.....
The only thing I hate with the Garmin (but this was also an issue with my former TomTom): It starts to go wild when rain is heave enough since it thinks raindrops are fingertips. But this is pretty much the only negativ I can say about my Garmin.
Great video, just a couple of questions:- I only have a phone no computer i phone 13 pro can i download onto the xt from that? Also will it show green lanes are they already installed, excuse my lack of tech knowledge
Great video. Bought it
Like a Which Magazine crossed with a Carry On film, ooh matron! Fantastic review Tim.
For my upcoming tour of South America, I am happy that Garmin has licensed iOverlander data to display in the XT.
Also the drive app is great for typing in addresses quickly
Been using my quadlock for 2 years I bought the one with vibration dampner I ride 60-80 miles nearly per day had no issues with my phone and I have the same phone as you.
I’m very much against my phone on my handlebars , they have become too important to us with the info they have at hand for our ease of use .my iPhone was over £1k not a top of the range but certainly around what you expect to pay for iPhone . it has all my important information on it , banking etc , if it became detached , stolen or damaged I’d be lost ..if you lost your phone and were stuck beside the road do you remember your wife’s or riding friends numbers , breakdown contact, your insurance company even the hotel your going to , even finding a roadside phone box is pretty difficult nowadays if somehow you can recall anything . I have got the XT as well and it’s brilliant ,…..I challenge you to turn your phone off and see how many numbers you can remember , don’t forget also if your phones damaged you might not be able to use internet either to help you out ,
great review!  I'm new to the GPS world, is there a monthly subscription and/or cost to download maps, local or international?
Thanks for the video, I've been debating on gettng one of these, I ride my bike so I can forget about my phone lol I prefer it in the tank bag hidden away.....I think I might invest in the XT....sláinte!
I really want one of these, and if I still had an adventure bike would get one in an instant. I now have an R nineT though and can't find a way to mount one without it looking ridiculous. Great review
I would like to know how to import a list (for example an Excel table) of points of interest directly from a PC to the Garmin Zumo XT? Or how can I add POIs (defined by coordinates) via computer?
Thanks for the video! I was just about to buy one from a local retailer for £350, when you mentioned the Bennetts rewards. Checked it out and I saved £87!!!! Thank you for the tip!
Hi, what about that round trip thing? You ever tried? Is it comfy to use?
I like this and you are funny! Thanks!
I picked up my first bike yesterday from the shop. It was a 65km trip back home and it took me 4 hours because I kept getting lost - my 65km had become 122km. I had tried memorizing the map before leaving but had to find a petrol station which threw my mental map out of kilt. Had to keep stopping to look at the phone as it was very difficult while trying to ride (and probably illegal). Verdict - need a GPS - and was looking at this one. Very timely review, thanks.  P.s. Can't believe the size of that monitor on the KTM - it's huge! Shame you they don't partner up with Garmin to offer gps functionality on that big screen.
Just upgraded from a Zumo 660 to the XT.  I tried to use an old phone and not even close.
I’ve had it for almost a year. In Canada it costs $679.99+ tax. Worth every penny! There is a lot of areas without the cell coverage where it works flawlessly.
Couldn't agree more - you'll notice I'm one of those motorcycle "influencers" who isn't sponsored by Quad Lock either - I was one of the the first to use a Quadlock, it completely trashed my £800 phone camera and QuadLock's answer was (a few months later) buy a vibration dampener!!  Stable/Horse/Bolted.  Like you I'll never risk another phone with them again, vibro dampener or not.....
I ‘ve never considered being distracted by music a benefit to safe riding nor to enjoyment of the bike or the journey.  I keep my phone for calls and photos and that’s it.  I prefer a dedicated satnav for touring.  Bmw navigator allows curvey route alternatives, multiple way points and the ability to skip any.  Waterproof, less to lose if damaged and just perfect for the job.
I'm still using my older phone for my sat nav, so vibration not a problem, I divert my good phone that I keep in my pocket to the old phone, and I can also see who is calling me when I'm riding and can also text/phone etc from the old phone on the bike in front of me.
Also, I can charge my phone from the USB charger and swap it from bike to bike. The only downfall I would say is the screen is not as bright as a sat nav. Many Thanks
Great review does the Garmin come with all you need to mount and wire it in or do you need some extra bits?
Thanks for that mate . Great review.  You can get a Tourtech lockable mount to . How do you hard wire it to your bike ?
Great video - I’ve a new Tenere 700 coming and I’ve spent days and days trying to find a phone solution - they’re really expensive and there are loads that won’t ship nice mounts to the UK.
Thanks
Good information there. I am running a second phone in my BMW cradle via an inexpensive adaptor and using Calimoto mainly but with the option to use Google maps and all was good and I especially like Calimotos clear speed camera warning.  My Troubles have begun to surface in the the vibration, dust ingress etc has made the USB charge port a bit loose so the phone now intermittently charges and is getting worse so there is another potential pitfall there with phone use. 
I can get it repaired for about £50 but as another option I've been looking at the Garmin XT ( Nav 6 is crap, now sits in a drawer)  especially as it's easy to load routes in via wifi. 
Does the Garmin offer speed camera warnings, especially in Europe?
The greatest issue with the GPS units I've tried has been performance. Since all of the chips are being thrown at phones,  perhaps the better move is to switch to GPS units without screens that a phone can connect to for GPS data and display through a dedicated app. Otherwise, the GPS could just use faster chips with more memory. I'd like to see that and a return to resistive touch screens with interfaces based on taps rather than slides AND big directional & volume buttons.

A phone is ok for around town, but a more rugged, weatherproof device with large screen text/icons focused on just directions/mapping is better for long trips. There's less need for it to be small/slim, so they good be built to be handled and repaired.
I use a Garmin car sat nav, they're a third of the price of a specific bike sat nav and does the same job.
Good review!!!! Question: does Spotify (still) work on the XT via the phone?
First-love that bike. I’m riding a 2018 1290s.  Currently I have the 396. Thinking of upgrading to the  XT. Do you think the extra real estate is worth the upgrade?
Eric, Black Swan Odysseys
I use a Garmin Montana because I do a lot of off-road and I can send messages or SOS over satellite without any signals.  I still think it’s a pain to use so I mostly use my phone and run them both when touring.  Never had a phone die on me, and if I did, I always have AppleCare so I’d just walk into any Apple Store and get II replaced or repaired.
Hello? F#$king thank you! I never thought it was a good idea to mount my phone on the handle bars. You've summarized my exact feelings/opinions about the phone/standalone GPS argument. Although, I don't recall having the accent.
Does this show live traffic like on your phone so yiu can re route if you see jams up ahead to where your riding to?
Quick question, can you lock the sat nav to the mount to stop it getting stolen, as I can with my Tom Tom?
The older we get the harder is is to read the smart phones in the sun. Then the iphone will get hot and go dim. I order the Garmin. No brainer. Thanks for the entertaining video.
I too prefer a sat nav to phone, great tip about bennetts insurance, been looking at an xt just got one through bennetts for £260 odd 😊
But does it come off the mount when off the bitumen, some sort of twist or locking mechanism would be piece of mind
Great video. Question for you as I could not find it on the Garmin site. Do you need to connect to your phone to use the weather app?
I'm curious why you don't use the app with your KTM TFT that connects your phone to the display. I have the Norden 901 Expedition which came with the Husqvarna Connect app. My phone stays in my pocket connected via bluetooth to my bike. I can navigate maps, music, pretty much everything via the control buttons on the left side of the handlebar (the same buttons that control ride settings, etc.).
Hi could you advise what aluminium mount that is you’re using for the Garmin. It looks very sturdy and ideal for my new Adventure R that I have on order. Thanks
I use sat nav because it doesn't over heat and people can't call me when I need to know which way to turn. Also I don't get distracting nonsense on sat navs.
Hi there, I’m new to Bike in and I have Kawasaki versus 1000 GT Would you recommend this satnav are the newest one XT2
For the music app, can you control the music from playing in your phone? or do you have to uploaded it to the garmin unit? Wondering if it can handle multiple bluetooth connections so I can pair both the phone to garmin, and headset.
Maybe you find it a stupid question.     But can you put movies and music on a sc card and play them right on the garmin xt2 ?

Does is also play Flac music files or only mp3 ? 

The movies could be usefull when in the tent at the evening.

Now i have the 595 world edition.   I can only find the xt2 that is for Europe.   Would it be possible to put on a few other countries on the sd card. F.e. when you go from Turkey to Iran ? It would be silly if you have to use your phone while having a dedicated gps device in your sight.
Does anyone know how to connect the sena 50r to it have a big problem
Interesting video 📹...I've used my phone in an UltimateAdons case,  but thats a pain when you want to take a quick photo. A Garmin or TomTom....maybe a second phone is my way ahead. And I still use a thing,  you may have heard of it,  called a ' map' 🤣!!. I fold up a page of the 'map' and put it in my UltimateAdons case. Cheers Steve
I just order the XT, replacement for my 14 year old Zumo. I thought this summer I would just use my iPhone on my Harley, did not work for these reasons, screen too small on iPhone 11, and it vibrate too much for my old eyes to see it.
Would be interesting to see the beeline moto review
Can you geocache with the zumo xt?
Great info. I'm in Texas and once one gets outside of the cities there are many areas with no cell phone signal and the same in other states so a phone is not a good option.
Can you play music apps on an ios device? And control them through a Bluetooth headset?
Get the rain poncho for your phone on quad lock and you are good to go
What would be even more brilliant is a Zumo XT with CarPlay over Wifi, or even USB (CarPlay Wifi adapters abound on Amazon/eBay/Ali/etc).
I think I'm right in thinking that your phone  may incur roaming charges depending on your service provider and country? Which wasn't mentioned.I have  a R1250 GS and keep procrastinating over this satnav or the Nav 6
Do u have to have a computer or mac to use it to it's fullest? Can it find byroads?
I wonder if to buy this, although now I use my old Samsung S21 for a satnav. But my biggest issue with Google maps is that I cannot save a route how I want it. But 500 EUR for this, I am still thinking..
Also, if you ride in areas where cell service is not available or spotty,  a navigation system will still work
Is this water proof? And does we need to download all the maps or it work like a google map like start point and end point
Phone based navigation is fine for commuting and people who don’t care about riding good routes.
Now dropped the iphone and garmin gps for the Carplay units C5 to use Calimoto, google maps, wazes and pandora music.  So far not missing the garmin
I use maps (on iphone) when i want to find something on the road and send it to garmin drive to send it to xt. Find something in garmin is always a pain
I sold sold my Tomtom 440 because it was too slow. Fine, until you get out of signal range then you've no satnav, now looking to buy a better satnav
lets be honest...the youngins whod probly mostly never get caught dead on an adventure bike... the trend is definitely changing though.  riders after 35-40 start to have close up vision problems.. when on trips, i prefer to have a dedicated larger screen for nav, and trying to fumble with a tiny screen with gloves on.. for me there is no comparison, they are different tools..and one should never replace the other...great vid.
Yes it’s worth it.
3:23 mini usb (not micro, which is very similar). You're right that's an old connection, wonder why it uses that!
Yes, much prefer a satnav to a phone. I use TomTom and it gives speed camera alerts, ETA, miles remaining, average speed through average speed cameras and has a side bar that shows distance to petrol stations, speed cameras, etc, en-route. 

Does the Garmin do this, please? 🤷🏼‍♂️

Edit: What was the fly's name?
There are many fantastic riding spots on the East Coast of the United States where cellular reception doesn't exist. In the middle of the country, it's the same story. I'm in the Philippines right now and can confirm there are fairly large swaths of land where phones don't work. We're a very long time from where not having a GPS on an adventure bike makes sense.
I've got the Zumo XT & Quadlock which I don't use for all the reason outlined
The other thing about phones in hot weather using nav will absolutely overheat your phone & it will shutdown, the Satnav won't
Mobile phones are for taking photos. However next season  I'm going to mount mine next to my new XT just for " fun ".
100% worth it! I'd rather have the Zumo XT taking the abuse on my handlebar than my smartphone any day. My one gripe with the XT is it does not want to connect with my Sena SMH-10 bluetooth. Anyone else have that issue? My Sena is 5 years old, it may just be time for an upgrade.
Big Calimoto fan with Quadlock then I bought the XT, now I hardly ever use my phone for navigation, huge improvement over my BMW Nav V too. Otherwise I use Google maps as a back up…
I purchased the cheapest Garmin GPS I could, which means it's meant for a car, but since I no longer ride in the rain, it doesn't matter. It's mounted on something or other from Amazon, but has remained rock solid ever since. The whole set up is probably less expensive than the Qual Lock mount alone. My 'phone stays in my pocket and I'm a very happy camper.
I can confirm earlswood McDonald's is terrible!!!. Thanks for info in the video dude ,think I'm gonna have to get one for gpx tet routes. The garmin is 20x better to read the screen on a sunny day compared to a phone screen.
As someone who lost their phone in an accident i would get one definitely
Yes my phone was just a cheap one and I went down the Oxford cliqr route as i am tight james blunt
My mount,case survived but my phone got sent to the stratosphere.
Never suffered with vibrations as it was mounted centrally
But if you shell out every 2yrs for a over a bag of sand on a phone.
Stick it somewhere safe and spunk 300 nuggets👍
Might be a bit ott for your usage but check out the Carpe Iter nav unit. Next level and what the Garmin could be. If they could size the Carpe Iter down to the XT size or thereabouts no one would buy anything else.
I have the Zumo XT and it's got its strong points.  However,  I want a weather proof wireless android auto device so I can have the benefits without exposing my phone.   It should have a bright functional touch screen same as the Zumo.
I was using a phone on the bike until I got stuck in a downpour at night in the middle of nowhere. The phone started screaming at me that it’s detecting water(no s***). Had a beeline on the bike. Couldn’t get it set up in the dark and in the rain. So I got pi***ed off. Bought a zumo xt next day. Phones are great-yes! Most of ‘em don’t like water though!
Can I record a journey without having to program a end destination I know with Google you have to have a start and a finish
Does it do satellite view?
Seems like I need both 😢.
Still use a Garmin Montana 600, it just works
PSA: "One is none and two is some" as the G.I. saying goes so I always carry a topo map and compass whatever else I nav with. My four-wheeled vehicles get a motor carriers road atlas bagged under the seat and a simple scout compass in the glove box. Practice land nav without the electronics until those are purely optional. It's not difficult and you won't have the "lost 2Lt" expression on your face if your fancy gear dies.
This might be a dumb question, but I've only ever used Google maps on my phone. With this kind of satnav/Garmin gadget, is there a monthly bill like having a second cell phone?
OK, one thing no one seems to comment on is, that a Sat. Nav. doesn't get lost when there is no phone signal.  Travel through a place where there isn't a mobile phone signal with a Zumo or other dedicated Sat Nav. no problem.  But, get 'lost' when using Google maps or whatever on a smartphone when there isn't any mobile signal and you're still lost!
The phone requires an internet connection to work the GPS properly. My ZUMO is fully self contained and will work every time! My ZUMO is waterproof, and the touch screen works with my gloves. I will never stop using my ZUMO, and will use my cell phone to make phone calls, as it is intended to do.
Phone screens aren’t as bright as the Zumo, and in my experience, phones overheat when in direct sun, unlike the Zumo.  There are ways around this (mount the phone with lots of ventilation, angle it downwards, so as not to catch the sun, etc.), but neither are issues w the dedicated nav system.
Zumo XTs rule.  Particularly with that mount...  Agree with all your conclusions.  I put a locking thingo on my GPS..  I also have an app on my phone that sends emails and alerts to the GPS.  Hours of mindless fun.
Before looking at this vid I just ordered a quad lock as they’re 30% off at the minute
Worst case for me would be a £100 insurance excess if the worst was to happen
I had a quad lock mount with the vibration mount.. The case was awful and so tight (pixel 4xl) that when I tried to prise of the case, it detached the screen from the body!!! also, the quad lock case is not easy to mount despite the advert showing it just popping on, it doesn't, you have to fart around with it.
the ancient usb connector failed after a few months, only plus it has over phone is screen visibility in sun
Completely agree with you, plus the smart phone's GPS relies on network connectivity most of the times and can not precisely tell where you are in some off road situation or mountains. Also the phone fails to detect your direction if you are not moving but dedicated GPS is spot on all the time. It happened so many times that google maps told me to go forward when I was static and then tell me to turn around because it detected the wrong direction while stopped.
There are loads of places not far from me where I can’t get a signal on my phone and the Garmin earns its keep.
If I did a lot of touring and adventure riding I would be much more interested in a dedicated GPS. But for urban riding and commuting, which is really all I do, I feel that my phone works better and it's cheaper.
….don’t mention the pwarn. 😊
Regards from Germany, where speeding has become more expensive than a quad lock mount.
phone in conjuction with old car sat nav in cradle ,paper map!! in tank bag window and hand written!!!! list of cities towns to head for. Can't see any of it without my glasses . Found the whole lot a total faff, dangerous and distracting while on the move, and really spoilt my ride most of the time. Now i just ride in the general direction till i need fuel, then browse the maps and roughly memorize my route till the next stop.The old days riding my airhead bmw with a paper map seemed so much more fun in retrospect, nowadays touring has become a chore and a worry. Google maps is ace for hotel/camp/fuel/food aside from that i'm just going to enjoy my ride .
How do i get one from bennets for 265
Phone is a better bet in virtually every situation in my experience. Phone sales dwarf sat-nav sales and the respective development budgets reflect that.
I just stumbled across your review video.  I have a Zumo XT that I am fairly happy with but would be much happier to use Google maps for on road navigation and GAIA for offroad or track navigation.  For those that follow Itchy Boots, she started a new season with a new GPS.  It appears to be a XENARC 7" tablet.  It is available with either an  Android or Windows operating system and has a docking station for easy charging available.  I am thinking of ordering the Android version.  I have posted a question on Itchy boots YouTube channel as to what GPS app she is using but have yet to get a response.
It’s good device this XT but sometimes in London it frustrates me with choice of route. Google maps does better job finding places and possibly has more direct routes using common sense.
I have the Tom Tom ride and it’s been very disappointing.
I’m looking to replace it with this.
These gorra fly on yer head!
Good video, i lost my money after this (by garmin) 😁 Thanks a lot 😁
Why the feck would you use a Garmin to find a sodding McDonalds?
Why the feck would you use Google Maps to find a squiggly green lane east of Finchingfield?
Exactly. Orses for Courses. Nice video mate.
After my second Garmin Edge 520 died unexpectedly I decided to try something different - the Wahoo ELEMNT Bolt instead of the Garmin 530. Boy! I'm glad I did. https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxXZCtB-wGdHVTBSz8RswePK5vllHNi06N The display on the Wahoo Bolt is much easier to read. I like the configuration of the display more (up to 7 items visible on page 1 without scrolling and the first item chosen is larger characters than the next 3 rows that have pairs of items (still very readable). I also like the configurable item selections. The Bolt synced with my Garmin ANT+ Speed sensors on both bikes easily so no additional investment was required there. While the rated battery life is a couple hours less than the Garmin 520/530, I easily get a weeks worth of 1+ hour rides before recharging (and it's never really low on charge). At the end of a ride syncing to the Wahoo app, Strava, and Apple Health app is painless.
Most people think the red square around where it connects is a o ring but it's just for looks it's plastic ask me how I know.. 🤦🏼
Gerardmer 👍✌️
Lots of laughs!
Android devices with dedicated apps give you so many more options and can always change apps. Like Gaia and others. Som much more can be done . Buy a cheaper rugged android device and put whatever mapping you want. Your never stuck with just Garmins software.
Had one last year sold it after a few trips. Garmin need to sort the un intuitive software out . Osmand maps and Google maps is much better.
The main difference i see is a phone does not work outside mobile phone coverage whereas gps works everywhere .
I have a quadlock with mobile phone and able download offline maps and sound to my helmet.  Garmin are obsolete really in my opinion.
Dedicated satnav all day long, google infested devices will never be as good and that weather radar is a really useful feature. Price is a bit high tho, at least for the computing power it's got, I'm sure it costs no more than about £12.50 to produce judging by the way it zooms in and out on the map.
Really not comfortable using my flagship phone under such abuse. My galaxy note 9 screen died and I'm convinced it was from the 100 degree heat during the summer.
Honestly I don’t get why all the mounting options for smartphones (except RAM) require a compatible phone case, I don’t wanna have a bad phone case all day because I use my phone for navigation on my bike… also my phones camera was destroyed by my bikes vibrations once. Im now also a proud owner of a garmin GPS…
I think the value of the ‘gadget feeling’ makes people buy navigation system. Google Maps is still king 👑 above TomTom and Garmin.. and yes vibrations could cause a problem, but than again do not go off road with your phone in a Ram mount.. on highways it is perfect and saves me a lot of money on a external Navi system.
New Iphone is around $1000....I just found a new/used Garmin Montana 750i for $375 on facebook...Sold the XT...it's awful. Purely awful. My big issue with it is the complicated way to get a track into it...then once you've rubbed your tummy, patted your head and hopped on one leg and you have the track in there...all your carefully selected waypoint icons are now...flags...nameless flags...because the xt also doesn't have icon labels. The only thing it does will is picking a curvy road from point a to point b....which...if you're using a gps on a bike, you've likely created a track you want to ride in some other software. Dont buy an Garmin XT...use a Montana 680 or 700 series on a bike if using tracks. Keep your phone safe in your pocket.
My xt ...
Crap vague mount , never confident that it has clicked in.
Constantly tells me to do a U turn , constantly
Pretty hopeless really, we usually use google maps because it's mental.
Do I recommend, no
I wasn't going to comment, Anyway....... And I'm certain this has been mentioned in the comments below, But you've omitted the most important reason for a stand alone GPS Satellite Navigation unit. 
The stand alone Sat Nav doesn't rely on internet data to work ! And Trust me, I've been to places where there was Zero internet. 
Its the same reason I have all my music installed onto my phone. Because It doesn't matter where I am, It will work.
You forgot to mention when rain hits the screen i doesn't go mental like a phone does.
"you can look at pornography" LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I subscribed just for that man thanks for the laugh!
Forget using a mobile in the South of Europe in summer, it's too hot for it, it will shut down. They cannot be used in rain , and iPhones are not built to take the vibrations on a motorbike. Good old satnavs will do the job!
Used to always reccomend tomtom because easier and cheaper, but since the price has come down so much, it's basically a steal!
surely if you want navigation, you use the zumo and IF you want a mcdonuts, just get you phone out. Also, gps devices are effective because they don't rely on coverage, they use satellites and they can be found anywhere in the world. Just saying.. A good review though, thank you.
Phones should always be on the rider. What if you get separated from the bike in a accident and can't get to it?
I prefer keeping the phone in my pocket.  My phone is not weather proof either.
Phones are as much use as a brick when there is no phone signal. Sat navs work in the middle of nowhere with or without a phone signal and you aren't being tracked.
Hi Tim - thanks, helpful review. I've got turn by turn satnav on the bike dash supplied from my mobile on Bluetooth, running the BMW Connected app  (so yes, phone is safe in my pocket). It works well and has got me places I would never have found without it and like the XT there is a slider for choosing the degree of winding routes. Downside though (Beeline / Triumph would be the same) is no displayed map - which is making me consider a dedicated satnav. One thing though - and I hope this can be taken the right way - enjoy your content, including general irreverence but please drop the porn jokes. Not helpful and likely to alienate any lady bikers out there.
But in Texas U.S.A. the heat kills phones ........ big problem !!!!!!!!!!!
Is silly to say the least to use a phone as a GPS on a bike, they small, not have the color or brightness & generally rely on data plus get damaged as. They for the pocket or panniers etc.
Peak Design > Quad Lock
slightly tounge in cheek but it's 3 whole mins before you get to the Garmin
Just switch off data roaming on your phone when crossing Switzerland.
I thought it was a coco pop 😂
Mini USB
If you ride proper dirt in SA you will rather want to have a Zumo sat nav otherwise your phone will not work when you have finished your trip.Cheers.
And if you are in an area without cell service and didn't preset offline mode to download the maps for off-line use.. you would be SOL.
It is so funny that all those phone versus satnav reviews always consider using an existing phone to a dedicated satnav. Why not review a dedicated rugged navigation phone? It is cheaper, faster, better resolution, waterproof, glove capable, runs  any nav app you may like. you need to couple only ONE bluetooth device (headset), so no messing with the correct order of coupling, it runs your favorite music app, speedcam warning app, tracking app. Compare an XT to a rugged phone, it wil ALWAYS lose... Simply buy a rugged phone, combine it with a DuoLock instead of an overrated quadlock, and you will still be cheaper AND have better hardware.
But not all not gloves are leather...
Ushaped bolt = Usain Bolt😂
I wonder what you think of the Ottocast CarPlay Lite C5 in comparison to the Zumo XT. I have and love my XT, but now that there's a pocket Android Auto/CarPlay for bikes all of that product's videos are making like a Zumo XT is a relic of a bygone era, to be lamented and forgotten for the rest of time, to the point that they make up complete bullshit lies about what the Zumo XT can and can't do.

It's really quite weird. The Lite C5 runs off of cell signal and everyone turns into a stuttering mess when I ask 'What happens if there's no cell signal around?'
I didn't hear a word you said the first minute: I was concentrating on that fly on your head. 🪰
5 to 10 quid on FB market place... get one with free updates Garmin...? seal it.. cheap mount easy.. done...
It looks underpowered, as in CPU.. noticeable by UI lag.. You can buy a second hand waterproof phone. Like a 3-4 year old flagship From Samsung..
Only real thing about this is the fact that I can work it with just normal gloves.. all the rest is nonsense my phone can do better
A GPS has a more reliable signal than a phone. The GPS gets its signal from a satellite whereas the phone depends upon “line of sight” to a cell tower. Yes, the GPS can temporarily lose it’s signal if blocked by a mountain or tunnel, but generally it’s stronger and more accessible than a cell signal.
The main thing- never ever TomTom!
Your sat nav is in ‘car mode’ you should switch to ‘motorcycle mode’ the routing will be better.
Garmin is dying....I see the minimal benefits but I can do anything I need with one device
Very entertaining, especially for someone with a taste for sh!t hamburgers!
Ja, 80s German porn!
The Garmin software on a Mac Mini is slow, outdated and quite horrible
You have a good sense of humor but you're being a bit pissy with your cons. It's a great piece of technology when your phone loses data stream. Mat not happen in Europe but in the States it can.
you have something on your head...and it's not hair.
I'd advice not to look at pornography in busy traffic.
Right up to the point you said damp-en-er 🙄
You claim to be a Grandad with a two year old phone…what’s wrong with that? 🤷‍♂️…so what’s wrong the eons old word that has served us so well? Damper. Please.
Wold be nice if it still was 300 pounds, they arent anymore.
I've got this Garmin and it's an absolute piece of shit, software wise. It's been designed by some old German grandfather who refuses to go beyond android 2. I usually search for the location of anything and then send it to the GPS because the user interface is very 1990s. User unfriendly, I'd say
Garmin has been putting out absolute garbage for decades.
They put sgit out that is FAR from stable.
I have had to factory reset Garmin devices literally SCORES of times.
My current POS Zumo XT is stuck on Japanese language. ZERO way to change it.
I have done factory reset 3 times.
Absolute  garbage company.
I hate my Garmin Zumo. It's junk from the 90s 🤮👎
Yeezz that Garmin is slow…..Better than using your current phone is using an old phone. Your current phone stays in your pocket. I use a Samsung S8 specifically for motorcycle navigation. Spend your money on petrol and ride.
If you change your phone every 24 months. Damage from vibration should be a none issue. Gps company's will soon go bankrupt.
Too much information. Ie. You tug yourself to bondage vids. Such a sad scene for a poorly shaven man with a beard in a dark room he grew up in.
