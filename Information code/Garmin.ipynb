look at whats inside the boxes as noted these are final production units from a hardware standpoint however they are currently running beta firmware  once i get final firmware ill aim for about  weeks later for an indepth review likely putting it midmarch plenty of goodness to comelove your videos theyre so informative so excited for the fenix sgreat video totally loved it great work many thanksthanks dcr looking forward to hearing about the features and benifits of the x for triathletes in comparison to the xt time to upgrade from the this will be my firstever fenix already preordered sapphire  and cant waitiv been waiting for this video very pleased to see it even though i wont be buying one for quite a while because i already have the fenix  they look fantasticthat b roll  great vidthanx dc rainmaker for the unboxing fenix x saphirethanks for the video would love to see a detailed comparison between the x and hr in one of the images the x looks slightly thinner than the hrthanks for letting me know the size of the s is about the same as the xt that is a much more manageable size for a person with smaller wristsgetting real better in the cinematography nice dcr question about navigation can you simply enter an address via the watch or phone and navigate there turn by turn or is the navigation function poi and random route based onlyho avuto e rivenduto dopo pochi mesi il fenix  hr ed ora voglio il fenix   nice unboxingsubscribedi think the sapphire is worth the money i owned a lot of mineral glass watches and they all had scratches after a few months i now own a saphire glass watch since  years and it is covered in scratches on the case but none on the glass so for a sport watch that will get in contact with gear nature etc i think i will definitely go for the sapphire and the x is a nobrainer from therehi ray love your vids en reviews question does this fenix lack the same issue as the fenix  when it comes to alti and barometer issues thanksvery thorough thank youat first chose the  over x due to batt stamina alone but wait my ultras would be hrs and have to bring chargerpowerbank anyways and prices for both x sapphiremetal are the samefinally settled on x and i can now sleep better great and helpful video thankshi thanks for a video at  u said x has different optical hr sensor right what is differenti preordered my x the day they opened for it dying to get it come ongreat video but why didnt you put them on your wrist i want to see what they look like on the wrist before i order one i liked your comparisons but i still have no idea what they would look like on my wrist and am still conflicted between the  and svideo of the watches on your wrist would be great the photos on your website are a help the fenix x looks the same size as the fenix  hr as far as i can tellwould have loved to see them on the wrist when you were doing the size comparison i am still torn between the  or the x and size is my biggest deciding factorim really interested in the  hr feature as an activity monitorgreat video thanks bossgreat video ray still love my fenix  so may wait until the fenix  comes out in a yeartwo but if i didnt have it id get the x i thinkit was very useful n intresting thank uray can you do a video installing the quickswap bands from the f onto the f wonder how does that work and does it work well i suspect on the f we just install the original pins without the original strap and put on the new quickswap bandsthanks for the ongoing coverage did garmin explain why they made the seemingly stupid decision not to use some of the gb storage for music playlistsdc please review the watch on a gymworkout environment i know its the best running watch but i want to know its workout performance because fenix  was weak and basically like a fitbitjesus ray are you using the tiny mic hole on some action camdoes the x come with both metal and rubber bands  most of the preorder websites show them as separate itemsthankshi ray is there any difference in sizeweight between the s saphire and the regular s  thanksgood companion i wanted to know your opinioni am taking pleasure to run and when i do a little better now it is very cold in my land i want to go out with the bike  i have been looking at your blog to see if i decide on the  sapphire fenix but i get many doubts  would you wait for another model better the x  it seems very big and i would use it for day to day but i would be guided by your opinionthanks for so much informationwhat do u think about the new sunnto spartan sport wrist hr baro would you say is a good watch for runninghi could you install tree benchmark from the connect iq store and see what score this watch gets and post back thanksdid i see it correct that only the x has a red ring around the upper right button does it have a extra function like on the cronos than on the  and s thanks great videogreat videothxgreat video coolhi rayim thinking about buying the s because ive a small wrist how about hr precision of fenix s vs fenix  as a smaller watch will fit better on the wristthankscan you explain the difference between the s and the s sapphire i know that it pertains to wifi but i am unsure what that means exactly i currently have a forerunner  and am looking for a big upgrade the  syncs to my phone when bluetooth is connectedthanks for the videos on the fenix  series can you confirm a feature or lack thereof for me the x has maps and i believe the roundtrip run and roundtrip ride are tied to that so im assuming the  and the s dont have that feature is that correct i think its a feature that could be included by using the garmin connect app on your phone have it generate a route and thensend turnbyturn directions to the watch i know not everyone carries their phone with them when they run or ride but some do i do its like they built the watches specifically the xto be completely independent understandable but then dont even bother to consider all the additional features they could havehad onthe  and swere the phone presentthe inner screen of the watches look like they are same in the diameter does resolution or inside diameter change for each or only the outside antenna gets bigger and biggerwould you suggest sunnto spartan sport wrist hr or garmin fenix  for daily running with gps navigation  dc rainmakerhi can you explain in depth once and for all  because i keep seeing different data in different places that compere the two  what exactly are the differences between fenix  sapphire and fenix s sapphire im off course not asking about size and weight  but things like wifi that some say that there are some fenix  sapphire without i already know about the battery life and pixels are there any more differences thanx so muchnot much enthusiasm in an inboxing video of a highlyanticipated device hopefully garmin has solved the altimeter issues specific to the wristbased hr sensor a few bummer moments in this videoi really want to be more excited to buy a fenix x but the combination of high price inconvenient charging cord lack of available nonhr version i just dont want buggy altimetergps or other sensor stuff and lack of nonsapphire x version with wifi kind of turns me off a bit plus my fenix  is still going strong with no issues soill wait for a few months to see how the fenix x is reviewed by folks before shelling out does the fenix x come with both the metal band and silicone band and does the fenix x have mgrsyou mentioned in the video that the fenix x watch band can be used with the fenix hr really interested about this can you make a short video on showing this compatibility i just bought a fenix  so i wont be upgrading anytime soon but im really interested in switching bands instantly to use between office and sportsnice roadbike tshirt what is itthank you this video that what i look for comparecan i use the mapping function of the x here in the philippines if i buy one from us or canadaafter trying the fenix  and the fenix x on your wrist which one do you like more was the bulk from the x really noticeable compared to the regular  i like the size of the  but i also really really like the idea of having maps on the x i will most likely be wearing this all the time so comfort counts any input would be nice thanksthanks always the firstcan you use the standard nato strap nylon strap that is commonly available  that is does the fenix  have a strap bar at each side that the nato style strap could slip behindany difference between the asia us and uk x version pls advice thanksis the fenix  have capable of inputing mgrs coordinates like the tactic bravohow would you compare a fenix  not x or s vs a fenix chronos leather i just love the all metal design of the chronoswhen will they start shippingwhat do you do with the watches you dont useon your site it has the sapphire  in both silicon and metal band coming with a different band yet on the x only the metal comes with the yellow band is that still the case seems only the x in black band doesnt come with the second bandseveral complaints about audio so i thought id suggest trying out the rode smartlav i am not educated in stuff like that but i saw a video with it and it sounded pretty goodhi is it possible attach not original band to f eg is f band compatible to f thanksone question hope u help me answer it  on your opinion garmin s or  garmin instinctlo que no aclaraste es que el vidrio del la version x es mas grande que la del  normal entonces la pantalla parece mas chica en el xits unclear to me if the s will work well with the hrm tri bundle because the garmin site doesnt allow you to select the tri bundle with the s model any thoughtsare they out nowhow are ppl saying they have these it shows me not available until  weeks on garmin website this would be my first fennix or garmin product really  hesitating on waiting for it to come out or just buying the fenix  hris there any way of pausing or disabling the stepswhat is the battery life of the x compared to the regular  i want the x but i dont want it if the battery life is horrible compared to the regular garmin until u put music storage on the fenix or the forerunner i will be waiting impatiently on the sidelines with my old but reliable  xtdid you mix up the battery life titles in your video hello my friendwhen it comes outeuropeside by side it looks like the fs is smaller than xt and f is slightly larger than xt thats interesting garmin i hope you stay like this with all the different reviews tests and insights dont get like richnose rizknows becoming a home order television channel begging for attention at casey neistatis it true that fenix  has better battery life than fenix xno seal on the boxlove your videos but the audio makes them almost unwatchable please get a decent mic ouch did that poor ol watch land okplease for the love of pete buy yourself a blue microphones yeti  good video tho  thanks  this is the black version and as you can see it is eh black  ddoes anyone know if garmin is going to continue to support the fenix  with new softwarecan you install offline maps on the si want to see the watchesis the battery life on all models the samethere is some issue with the audio dude its pretty badwhy did they skip  as a fenix  owner i was thinking to myself am i that out of the loopwhere do you buy one  hard to find in dfwafter all the issues with the fenix  failing to sync ill never run with garmin they must think people have money to burn so they can charge such high prices for unreliable gear whats the point in creating a watch if you cant pull the data off itmy girlfriends dad likes garmon like the military style with the green bandnot a single online unboxing with the steel version of the bracelet disappointthe t shirt drives me nutsthanks dcr when do you estimate your full review will come out please if you could give the altimeter and barometer a thorough test i just got rid of my fenix hr which suffers from a defective altimeter and barometer see httpsforumsgarmincomshowthreadphpfenixhrbarometeraltimetererrorspage not sure if i should trust

or u use all tree on the hand good lord these watches are huge and expensive dont see the point heavy  bulky  expensiveyour shirt is out of focus couldnt take my eyes off it either very distracting  i dont understand anybody should be interested is this device read some analyses ray youre wasting time so much more important things to investigatereport  very much on the brands side as well just like with specifying prices as  or giving us the brands excuse theyre working on it when their software isnt functioningwhy arent you covering the problem many people are experiencing with their fenix s abc functions it is dishonesty by omission imo reviews should include positive  negative issues otherwise they are just adverts made by people who want to get free stuffi know you are fully aware of the issues because people have asked you to helpthere is also the separate matter of how garmin has treated their customers over the last year which has been shamefulspeak up on this pleaseits so hard to find a video like thistalking about cycling watches pairing and othersthak you a keep up the good workjust what i needed to properly use custom routes in navigation within the cycling app thanksgreat this video really helped me to get into this feature in notimeat first i was shocked by the sound level of the introduction  i watch videos with a headset and it was painful but the video itself was good and you actually showed me a function that i wasnt aware of although i have the fenix  now for over a year  nicefantastic video mate  getting a fenix  next week because of thishey john i really liked your review had a good sequence of events and clear video and onscreen examples would have been great to see how you add data to garmin connectstrava but besides this it was greatthanks this was very usefulappreciate your review brosubscribedany idea of the maximum battery life when using it on the bike like this with that backlight ontoday i did my first ride on a new course in an unknown location using the fenix  as a navigation deviceit was a disasteri planed the track on komoot and imported it via garmin connect to my watch thanks to your and a couple of other videos i knew how to get startedmost of the time the watch told me to turn leftright a couple of seconds after i passed the particular road i had to turn in toabout a dozen time  i didnt go a message at all i only noticed the beep and not on track symbol and the red arrow chanced direction instantlyi lost count on how many times i did a uturn to get back on trackvery helpfuldo you have to be in a bike mode starting activity for it to alert you  i use my edge to track data but would like my watch not being used for activity trackingto alert me if a car comes nearbywhen car is approaching is it only graphics on screen or also vibration  sound on watch im riding with watch on my wristis there a easy way to start cycling activity on garmin fenix s with a no press at all  the auto detects my movement when i start to cycle and when i stop to cycleb with one press to start to one press to stop  like some shortcut settingcurrently i can only find a way to press top right button three times  to enter app list  to select cycling and to start  when i stop i have to press to pause not to end and wait for a few minutes to have the option to stop and save the activity  i just feel its a bit too complicateddo you need to have the sensors for avg speedi think all your videos are now appearing on my suggested listor maybe i should have your old fenix  great review of features clean and tight video im wailing between  sapphire and x mostly since they are really close in price im leaning towards x so i get the maps though i think the x might be too big for my small wrists o really interesting to see that the regular  has some navigational features that you showed in the video though might have to revaluate againis there an option to have your watch vibrate if the varia detects a vehicledo you think it can replace the garmin edge  or any edge for that matter thanks for the videogreat review  just wondering does the varia radar pick up motorbikes or just carstrucksexcellent video  the video was very clear and well edited  im debating on getting an edge or upgrade from my fenix  to the x  im a cyclist so this video helped  thanksgreat video picked up a few tips which ill try out tomorrow what heart rate sensor are you using i assume you need a special one to enable the watch to figure out the aerobic anaerobic parts of the ride or is it just going after your pulse without measuring the o levelthanks for the great review just a quick question do the various outputs eg speed distance altitude pressure etc have units attached to them or just the numerical value thxthanks for the info can you use your di to move through the screenslooking to buy a new garmin watch  will the fenix s and  do the same as the watch you used in the video  also does it stay lit up the entire ride  thankshiya if you just have the watch on your wrist is there any way for it to give you information from your varia ie by vibration or by beepingi ride with a wahoo bolt and i have a garmin  fenix  plastic im wondering about getting the varia but id prefer to keep the watch on my wrist i used to have a fenix  and ride with it on the same mount you are using so i could always do that again i supposedo i need to buy the speed and cadence sensor for my watch so that it can detect the distance and speed i own a fenix s plusthe loudness of the intro in comparison with your smooth silent voice may cracked my inner ear hi i would you like knwof if is possible change page on fenig using key upper dican i use the varia radar paired with the fenix  the software of my fenix  freezes when using navigation on longer rides and the only way our is an hard reset disapointing any similar experiencehello sir i have fenix  pro the future that shows cars on the watch doest come with it or do i need extra accessoriescan you switch pages on the watch with di shifter buttonsgreat video have to say the varia integration looks like a total afterthought from garmin giant data fields but when a car might be ready to mow you down you get little bands running up the side reallyhi what is the name of the bike watch holder where did you get it fromhow long does the battery last with all the cycling sensors connectedwhat is that watchface at   its pretty cooles un xgreat review is there a cadence featurethis model is fenix  sapphireyour voice is very very quiet and your intro sequence very very loud     need to do some work on your sound levels dude reduce your intro volumewhy not wear it on your wristwarning at  really cranks his volume with his intro musicvideo if you have buds or headphones on you may damage your hearingi recommended all video channel people watch a video on how to set fixed audio volume across the videos they make and uploadno do not check volume level be another amateur that cant even check something so simple  wtfes un xes un xthanks dc for making these kinds of in depth videos  really helps out people like get a feel of the functionsnice change for the introloved the new introlove the new introseems pretty good could you also do a run with the s to compare the weight vs the also interested in the optical heart rate sensorthanks a lot for your videosa comparison between the hr strap and optical hr sensor would be awesomewould love to know if the alti  barometers finally work as this was my reason for ditching the f great vid with more info on the fgreat videos would be cool if you could test how the x is to use for mointainbiking navigating the trails and keeping an eye on speed heart rate cadence and so onthanks dc rainmaker for the review on how well the fenix  updates pace  ive had my fenix  sapphire for a week now and am still learning it  something im having trouble with is connecting it to my home wifi  went through all the settings through the usb cable to my computer and garmin express  but it still says im not connected when i sync  reading other places that other people are having similar problems  any help sorting this out would be appreciated dc rainmaker  there appears to be other metrics ie lactate threshold that apparently will take some time for the watch to learn me first  thanks again for your great reviews and info videosi like this test i dont know why this is important but i like it i plan to buy this watch please do a workoutgym setting review how well the hr works and calories burned etcvery useful video ray have you an idea of how this compares to earlier fenix watches i have the original fenix  sapphire version debating whether to update to the another great review from dccan you tell something about the indoor function it should give the pace without the gps is that quite accurate how is the interval coached  by a noticable beep to bad endomondo doesnt support a foodpod great audiocoach with the intervaltrainingplanswould have loved to see how you looked like filming this lol good job as alwaysim really excited for thisis there a release date yet i know its supposed to be in march but im thinking about taking a day or two off work to test it outhey dc i love your reviews i have a fenix  hr and am contemplating purchasing an edge  or similar garmin my question is will i have to start a cycling activity on the fenix in order for heart rate data to be transmitted to the edge during the ridethank you for these fenix  videos so how about with a x  a sky dive to a mountain snowboard road cycle run to a beach and a swimthanks for sharing such a useful explanation on the use of pace on the fenix  i like to request a overview of a training on a bike paired to the ant meters like cadence watts  other bike dynamicsmaybe its capable of connecting to bluetooth watt metersim planning to buy a fenix  of x to use as dailydriver to log various workouts as cycling running tabatta  strengthtraining spinning skiing etcdo you advise to buy the x over the  on use the sports above great video how accurate is the new calorie counting from firstbeaton the fenix would be nice a reviews of gimbals for the virb ultra  and video setting based on activity walk troughdc i plan to use the fenix  for cardio weight training and inline skating workout  would like to see you test it in those scenarios with and without hrm  thanks and tgifhi ray thanks for this video  would it be possible to have a review of the mapping options for the x my main point is can i enter an address to bikerun to like the edge  thanks again and enjoy spainhi for the first time users of the garmin fenix series watches can you show how you set it up to get the most out of the watch and the metricsgreat video thank you for constantly making my wife go crazy with how much i spend on fitness tech and on that note which gimbal did you get to work with the virb ultra   i dont need one at all but of course i am going to get one thanks for all you do for our communityyou mentioned you are wearing a hr strap in this video did you by any chance compare the unpaired hr strap to the wristbased hr of fenix does the fenix  have the same bug still as the   as in if you have alerts set   save the settings folder for the sports then reset the watch back to factory settings then put your settings folder back on the watch  the alerts will work but the ability to change that alert is gone   thankshi ray looks like you already long time using fenix  quick question is it make sense to buy hrmtri strip to use together with fenix hey dc we need some extensive comparison to fenix hr a lot of people are asking themselves question is it worth upgrading from hr cheersray  was this with the recently released  firmware  the instant pacing looks promisingrequest how well does x hold to a course its navigating can it effectively serve as a navigational tool with navigating streetstrails where tall buildings trees and walls of rock obscure sky how does x compare with predecessors and competitorshiis it normal for the pace to oscillate during a relatively constant running speeddc i was wondering if the fnix  has the same problem in extra steps while driving and does that effect your total calories burn for the daythank you very much ray for this great review  i understood you were using a gopro for your shooting would you please briefly let us know about your setup how to have the heart rate pace etc mirrored in your video thank you very much looking forward to your fenix  in depth review mid marchhow long it last before it obsolete it is beautiful but does fitness tracker at this price point is worth it im looking for my first real watch that looks good and tell time at a glance at my wrist and maybe a bit of music control functionif i get a smartwatch like this instead traditional quartz watch fitness is not necessary for me as i think all the number i get from the data wont directly help me i improve my jogging on my own way although i didnt own and experiences any fitness tracker yet do you think fitness tracker make sense and useful for medoes fx upgrade or change their abc and gps sensor or micro ship from fhr  i was own fhr and found the the abc and gps sensor are suck now it already sold as a nd handrunning at a  minmile pace while holding arm up filming and having a conversation haa the gopro did a good job toocan you record and upload the fenix  instant pace problem thank youthanks for the review dc whats the intro songstill waiting for my x but around here with luck i get it in aprilwhat do you think for how many years fenix x should lasttry do the same test in a forrest could be interesting to see if f is just as accurategreat cannot wait to upgrade my fenix  to x its a shame that the apple watch  is crap for running cause of inaccurancyhey dci need advice please from your experience fenix chronos for  usd or fenix  usd and how long does garmin keep supporting and updating firmware for their productswhats the purpose of testing anything gps related near the sea on clear day its perfect conditions for gps reception try do same test in downtownif you have an android device can you try sleep as android with it  i know its still very much in beta for garmin devices right now but id like to see how good it is  also i believe you should have some devices that are not so much in beta for saa that you can comparea good smart alarm is a huge feature of a smartwatch for me but is hard to find good info about  sleep as android is fantastic and very featurerich from the phone end of things controlling smartlights and everything but having it be able to play nicely with a wearable or having the wearable be able to do its own smart alarm would be better for a number of reasonssadly many of the devices it is easy to find info about using as a smart alarm also have terrible battery life and therefore need to be charged basically nightly as it is so it wouldnt easily fit in my daily routine ie android wear whereas several garmins have enough battery life that i ought to be able to get my x info from them including sleep trackingsmart alarm and then some training in and still reliably make it to the weekend where i wind up tethered to my apartment and can charge it then anyways laundry daywasnt that supposed to be standard already im asking cause my polar v just nails the pace from day one march  in my case comparing to what you showed here with fenix  polar v is waaaaay more responsive in pace matter in fact when i stop it takes him not more than  second to go down to zerocan you review only the band ex fenix  vs hr vs  the hr was came with a nice strong band much better from fe  the look of fenix  band is very simiral with the fenix  is strong like hr bandall rightraywhere is this beautiful place make more f videos please  regardless the topicwhere in spain is that  dc rainmaker i think i figured out why the fenix models have more hard times than other garmin watches to figure out a probable instant pace would you take a look at this httpsforumsgarmincomforumonthetrailwristwornfenixscurrentpaceallwrongpossiblecausepostand maybe in you think it is interesting as other forum users do possibly try yourselfi will never get the obsession with instant pace its virtually meaningless unless you have very high tech equipment in every review you spend an inordinate amount of time on this statto the exclusion of other important information  im sure a lot of people claim they want to know but we should really educated them on the issues with instant paceso better the the apple watch nikefor someone doing a gentle jog youre quite exhausted youre breathing like you ran a marathon you must have gotten some really weird looks when doing thisgreat videos would be cool if you could test how the x is to use for mointainbiking navigating the trails and keeping an eye on speed heart rate cadence and so onmapping capabilities are what ive been really missing on the fenix  time to preorder the fenix x very nice review thank youhow about golf how many courses can it load does it show bunkers and water hazardshi tnx for the review please review the swimming function if possibleadvice when making video like this put the watch on a surface and camera on a tripod  the focus will be constant and it will be easier to see the menus right now the camera is moving the watch is moving  makes me dizzycant wait to see what trickles down to current forerunner devices via firmware update and future forerunner devices do you know if the garmin elevate sensor hardware is new or the same in older watches with firmware improvementswill any of these updates be able to apply to fenix hrshort question to the normal fenix is it able to navigate preloaded tracks which are tranfered trough garmins basecamp as my fenix i just got my fenix  and i dont know how to get to the place where you can update the softwhere if you could help me it would be greatly appreciatedis there any connectivity with c rowing machines with pm or pm can i synch erg data from my phone to the garmin app or the garmin fenex great video thanks is this the normal fenix  or the x i ask due to you having the maps on display i think its cool how you can see your maps like this does it require wifihi dcr is there a way to see my previous rides on my fenix x which were recorded by my edge   in other words does fenix x somehow sync with garmin connect and show me my cycling exercises that was recorded by other garmin devices like garmin edge etci did not see a geocaching activityprofile like the first garmin fenixtactix does the fenix x have paperless geocaching unlike the via coordinates on the fenix are you able to do offroad routes with the x i read it is supposed to have topo maps wondering if you can have it generate an offroad route like you were able to in the city i have several parks around that have tons of small trails would like to be able to specify a distance and have it pick the trails for me when i am being lazy very beautiful watchwhen is the realise date actually i appreciate you talking fast the video is already  minutes longer then my attention span agree tripod and flat surfacelove it i think i need to buy oneplease how put you the maps in the garmin fenix  can you please let me know which maps the phone has by defaultwhat is you opinion of the x vs epix i just got an epix but it can be returned obviously no heart rate monitor is a big difference on the epix mapping up to par on this new watch vs epix or better screen pixel count noticeable upgradeis the navigation on all the fenix s or just the x that has topo mappingdc rainmaker can i add a compass or direction of travel on the watch face when customizingyes besides the speed i cant tell which button you are pressing other than thatgreat watch great features i look forward to getting mine this weeki bought the fenix x sapphire  modelim a marine so i wanted something durable and rugged but also very functionalyou talk fast lol   good video  thoughthis is the fenik x right because has maps availablehi ray do you know if things like saved locations and my stats get saved back to the connect app im wondering if upgrading from hr to  will lose these or not tahow many screens we can built for the activity in the fenix  the limit was  if im right and how many digital watch facesdo you have any idea how many times you can recharge the battery before it falls to  of its original capacity and can the battery be replaced economically or do you just toss the watch in the trash i glanced away when you were going through the sensors and i couldve sworn you said stephen king sensor i had to watch carefully and find that you were saying speed and cadencehow do i get this watch to work on the golf course i have the garmin golf app on my phone is this watch a gps on the golf course basically want to only wear the watch on the course and not take my phonedoes fenix  regular version has map function  like the real time tracking so we can navigate by fenix i thought that only fot x omg i am confusedcan you navigate to a mgr grid with that watch  and set units to metershow is the brightness of the screen compared to fenix  thats about the only thing that i really want improvedwill it show incoming call alerts when paired with an ios devicemaybe i should play this in slow motion it might end up being useful years later is it still workingdoes anyone know where to find explanations for all the activities tactical boating ectso what that fuzzy green dog in the background doesnt moveyou speak very fast owill this pair to a stages indoor bikethe display should go all the way to the bezel not have a second inner black ring bezel with the brand name these smartwatches need to utilize the entire watch face  not be constricted by a false outer black band around the displayapart from the lack of wifi in some of the  series it looks to be over all a good smartwatchi did not have all those options under maps  mine stopped at auto zoom  what am i missingcan you show topo mapsis the  watches significantly faster than the fenix x watch when it comes to maps such as navigating and loadingbro are you jacked on caffeine  slowww downis garmin going to update fenix  os as well in order to let fenix  owners to have this circular menuhow is it different than fenix are there any reasons to get this over fenix  i was just about to order fenix  sapphire hr when this was announced now im not sure which to go forpity the display isnt using the whole of the available space looks weird with the big black outer ring probably no bigger than my xt or smaller evenwhich buttons to press for thesedo the maps work with trail maps too for hiking mountaineering trail running etccan you connect bluetooth headsetsi love the idea of watches they definitely have the coolness factor but until im running multiple marathons a year i cant justify the purchase in my minddoes it support geocaching and is there an interval timer available for hiit or tut traininghow do i get maps on fenix   plz helpmaybe they will release something at ces way better than any productproper syncing to other appsi dont have round trip course i have fenix  i just have courese activities saved locations sight n go and coordinatesis wifi worth it what are proscons of wifi vs bluetoothuhh yeah you can do the exact same customization on all the fenix hello my fenix doesnt have map i dont know how to install the map i try several times but fail could you help mecan it take elevation data from the map the epix could not even though the map supports it lack of updatesaudio feels like i had a stroke at the end of the videocan it stream music via bluetooth to a btheadsetdoes this have mgrsplayback speed   sorted is there a topographic map in all fenix  modelssuunto  or garminyou talk to fast and move those fingersi like it but with garmins track record it will take  years of updates before it works properly  actually you have the x in the review not the  misleading titledoes it show calories counterdc rainmaker who do you think the x appeals too  if you arent doing camping or hiking on a daily basis i am not sure i need the functionality  if you are running around the city having different routes seems cool but i dont know how often i would really use that feature  whatwho would you recommend the x over the  forcan make route  on map directioni usually like rainmaker but good lord please slow down the pace you speak way too fast for easy followinggreat review but good grief that reflection is annoyingi want to get this if there is weightlifting option nowis this a gps watchwhy the rushcan it count temperaturecant see a thing with the reflection on the watch and the camera moves shouldve used a tripod plus the sound is quite badseems as easy to scratch the bezel around the clock as it was on f sighi have a s but dont see points of interestand vs gear sill stick to my ambit  peak i had a fenix  hri took it back to best buy lolyes yes you can do a lot   but can you slow down      are you on speed or just drink  red bulls a dayso frustrating youre not telling us what buttons you are pressing i cant figure out how to use this thing and i learned nothingur going  fast explaining the functions of the watchexcellent information found your rate of speech to fast for me as i am a newbiemany of the acronyms i need to read up on overall thank you for sharingwhy use  or more fingers at the same time and do it so fast when doing a guide video i dont se with button you press and you are sooo fast that i do not have time to followi bought mine for firstbeat capabilities  i would much prefer looking at a map on a bigger  space at least   inches  you talk too fast rayhi you are very slow please talk little bit faster damn dont have more than one finger on a button its great that you sometimes tell us what you are pressing but the rest of the time it is a guessing game for us because you have multiple fingers on multiple buttons grrrrif you talk for fenix  x and navigations and maps change your titletooooo g d fastcan you speak even faster do you really believe the someone can track  youtooooo damn fast could you slow your speech down please it might be ok for those who are familiar with your accent but for us in the uk it sounds like another language also you have your fingers and thumbs at the same time covering the buttons so it is hard to tell which you are pressing for a beginner like me you need to say what each button is and what it does thankslooks like you are an expert most of us are not trying to get my first garmin  plus and even stopping the video still got a headache slow down pleasetalking way too fastyou talk way too fasttalking way too fast with poor enunciationdude slow down youre pressing five different buttons and not even talking about what youre doing  minute slow down youre talking so fast it hard to even figure out what you are sayingthis video is worthless its too fast to followit would be great if you would take your time to show new users to get it so here is your thumbs downway to fast mate  this is poor teaching all youre doing is telling  showing us how much you knowthis watch is ok but when i found out it only lasts for  years for that money its simply a rip off and a waste of techi am really really happy with my garmingreat content and really well made video tyhey mate can you do a comparison of the accuracy of hr between the f and f hr in a workout gym and running scenario thanks matethanks nice videowhere did you get your fenix  fromhow comfortable did you find this to wear it is a big watchdoes this have the fishing mode with tides and moon my garmin fenix  has stopped syncing but i cant figure out whyblue tooth is on on my phoneany thoughtsdoes garmin have a smartwatch with touch screeni got mine yesterday its so hard to find a video like thistalking about cycling watches pairing and othersthak you a keep up the good workjust what i needed to properly use custom routes in navigation within the cycling app thanksgreat this video really helped me to get into this feature in notimeat first i was shocked by the sound level of the introduction  i watch videos with a headset and it was painful but the video itself was good and you actually showed me a function that i wasnt aware of although i have the fenix  now for over a year  nicefantastic video mate  getting a fenix  next week because of thishey john i really liked your review had a good sequence of events and clear video and onscreen examples would have been great to see how you add data to garmin connectstrava but besides this it was greatthanks this was very usefulappreciate your review brosubscribedany idea of the maximum battery life when using it on the bike like this with that backlight ontoday i did my first ride on a new course in an unknown location using the fenix  as a navigation deviceit was a disasteri planed the track on komoot and imported it via garmin connect to my watch thanks to your and a couple of other videos i knew how to get startedmost of the time the watch told me to turn leftright a couple of seconds after i passed the particular road i had to turn in toabout a dozen time  i didnt go a message at all i only noticed the beep and not on track symbol and the red arrow chanced direction instantlyi lost count on how many times i did a uturn to get back on trackvery helpfuldo you have to be in a bike mode starting activity for it to alert you  i use my edge to track data but would like my watch not being used for activity trackingto alert me if a car comes nearbywhen car is approaching is it only graphics on screen or also vibration  sound on watch im riding with watch on my wristis there a easy way to start cycling activity on garmin fenix s with a no press at all  the auto detects my movement when i start to cycle and when i stop to cycleb with one press to start to one press to stop  like some shortcut settingcurrently i can only find a way to press top right button three times  to enter app list  to select cycling and to start  when i stop i have to press to pause not to end and wait for a few minutes to have the option to stop and save the activity  i just feel its a bit too complicateddo you need to have the sensors for avg speedi think all your videos are now appearing on my suggested listor maybe i should have your old fenix  great review of features clean and tight video im wailing between  sapphire and x mostly since they are really close in price im leaning towards x so i get the maps though i think the x might be too big for my small wrists o really interesting to see that the regular  has some navigational features that you showed in the video though might have to revaluate againis there an option to have your watch vibrate if the varia detects a vehicledo you think it can replace the garmin edge  or any edge for that matter thanks for the videogreat review  just wondering does the varia radar pick up motorbikes or just carstrucksexcellent video  the video was very clear and well edited  im debating on getting an edge or upgrade from my fenix  to the x  im a cyclist so this video helped  thanksgreat video picked up a few tips which ill try out tomorrow what heart rate sensor are you using i assume you need a special one to enable the watch to figure out the aerobic anaerobic parts of the ride or is it just going after your pulse without measuring the o levelthanks for the great review just a quick question do the various outputs eg speed distance altitude pressure etc have units attached to them or just the numerical value thxthanks for the info can you use your di to move through the screenslooking to buy a new garmin watch  will the fenix s and  do the same as the watch you used in the video  also does it stay lit up the entire ride  thankshiya if you just have the watch on your wrist is there any way for it to give you information from your varia ie by vibration or by beepingi ride with a wahoo bolt and i have a garmin  fenix  plastic im wondering about getting the varia but id prefer to keep the watch on my wrist i used to have a fenix  and ride with it on the same mount you are using so i could always do that again i supposedo i need to buy the speed and cadence sensor for my watch so that it can detect the distance and speed i own a fenix s plusthe loudness of the intro in comparison with your smooth silent voice may cracked my inner ear hi i would you like knwof if is possible change page on fenig using key upper dican i use the varia radar paired with the fenix  the software of my fenix  freezes when using navigation on longer rides and the only way our is an hard reset disapointing any similar experiencehello sir i have fenix  pro the future that shows cars on the watch doest come with it or do i need extra accessoriescan you switch pages on the watch with di shifter buttonsgreat video have to say the varia integration looks like a total afterthought from garmin giant data fields but when a car might be ready to mow you down you get little bands running up the side reallyhi what is the name of the bike watch holder where did you get it fromhow long does the battery last with all the cycling sensors connectedwhat is that watchface at   its pretty cooles un xgreat review is there a cadence featurethis model is fenix  sapphireyour voice is very very quiet and your intro sequence very very loud     need to do some work on your sound levels dude reduce your intro volumewhy not wear it on your wristwarning at  really cranks his volume with his intro musicvideo if you have buds or headphones on you may damage your hearingi recommended all video channel people watch a video on how to set fixed audio volume across the videos they make and uploadno do not check volume level be another amateur that cant even check something so simple  wtfes un xes un

muchexcellent handson review on the features and how to operate the garmin forerunner  nice one mate wonderful walk thru your info is straight and to the pointhi thanks for the detailed review ive been running for about  years and finally looking to get a watch to track my runs instead of my phone looks like this is the right one for mejust seen this video today reason ordered one that was refurbished  with  year warranty  your video is very informative for sure now can get started in no time im a cyclists have garmin edge explorer but doesnt do any other things thanksgarmin connect is brillant it connects very quickly it helps me alotcan you add kayaking activity on the forerunner hey mate can you control logging interval of heart ratehello   im having a hard time finding out if it comes with all you need to go as far as charger wire and cradled  im scouring amazon and its like    and then   with wire bundle    do hey really sell this without all the items needed and you have to buy wire and charger separate i couldnt find you link to supporthay what do you think is a better watch this is the polar m i like the size of this but the way you can adjust gps intervals on m to save battery also for gym work what is bettercan you use a footpod for this for indoor running on a trackdoes it broadcast hr to alle bike computers which support ant or does it only broadcast to garmin computerslove ithelloi just want to ask about the meteo coz is it only me that cant  see the meteo in my garmin forerunner  it always says waiting for data even though its already connected to my smartphonethankshow long to charge and how long does it last per chargedoes this give real time info if im doing a trail run ie can i see my pace and distance ran as im racing thanksdoes the watch track the pace of every miles  i would like to improve my running time currently im dont know what distance and time for my runhi can you view a map of your run route on the connect appare you able to control podcasts in the music controlthank you so much for a great video the user manual stinksif i buy a new one in jan   would the battery still be as new considering that the watch was released  years agogood daystopwatch available for this frhi is it possible to se what speed you are travelling at when cycling on a bikecan this watch go under the sea and how deep is music volume control possible from music control menu thx can you swim with itjust  watch faces still worth buying it in thank your for the concise quality review great jobok mate ive got to say you absolutely nailed that review i need to be able to review like this it was short snappy but had everything youd need to know youre a natural hands down one of the best reviews ive seen on yt thankswhile you cant access stride length on the watch it does track it and load to garmin connect which is nicethank you this helps me make a decision yesvery solid review great remarks and informative is the pacer good when  it tells you your on pace   is there any other watch would you suggest  or would you stick to it thanksjust the video i was looking for this video came at the perfect time since this past month ive been interested in the fr but i couldnt find a  review cant tell you how happy i am to have stumbled upon thiswhere u get ure tshirt fromnice review  i love this watch  i really wanted a heartrate monitor on my watch but not all the other complicated stuff some of garmin watches offer  when you download your run to your garmin app it will give you the cadence its so simple  i had an epson and i never did figure it outsuper helpful review thanksgreat review sirwhat about cirkle you run did exist thatgreat review i recently bought vivoactive  as i do more than running now excellent reviewgreat review jordan i like to be able to review my activity without having to transfer the data anywhere am i able to call up my last run on the watch and scroll through the speed of each mile  i was able to do this on my  which has now expiredgreat review  i want to get this watch for my dad but he sometimes has trouble viewing small numbers in a watch he really just wants to keep track of his heart rate while exercising i was wondering if the watch could be set to only show the heart rate numbers to get really big numbers also he goes out in his bike at night so i was wondering if the screen could be kept with the backlight on without having to press the button so he can constantly look at the watch without the hassle of turning on the backlightthanks a loti have seen the run walk feature on video but is it also possible to apply walkrunwalkrun or is this possible with the interval optioncan it show kmh max in the display or the app i am considering to use it in an rc boat for max speed reference an answer would be much appreaciated awesome vid btw cheersthanks jordan seems like a nice watch for the money whats your regular fitness watchwhen using the watch does the gps record the location of your runs do you need your phone when running with the watch to record your locationcan you leave the screen on heart rate when doing an activity or does the display revert back i just want to see heart rate without constantly pressing a buttondoes the data transfer directly across to strava via iphone at end of a run or does it have to be near computer to do soi know this review is old but ill post this question anyhow does anyone know if this watch can be set up so the heart rate monitor stays on the screen its frustrating that i have to keep pushing the button to see my bpm the only reason i even have this watch is to monitor my bpm during workouts thanks in advancein addition to running can you use it for activities such as crossfit or zumba my chest strap monitor is becoming a pain and im looking for a watch that will tell me my heart rate and calories burned during a workoutnot a stop watch wow okay great info tygood workis this watch able to be used safely for lap swims in a pool for durations of  to  minuteshey man im training pretty serious and i need a gps watch i just want to buy a good quality budget gps watch that can last me for  years or so i hate to worry about buying new gadgets after  yearis this watch a good fit for my needsthanks youve just helped me decide on it to amazon i go  god bless youdude help me out here pls vivoactive  and forerunner  are now on sale for  which one should i pick is it possible to change the strap to a different brandthis review was so helpful but im not sure what you mean by there is no stopwatchgarmin forerunner  or huawei gte sport  what do you think i hear you saying the cadence feature is good for beginners but not for more advanced runners  how come thankshow does this work for hiking elevation gain or anything like thatgreat video dude too pricey thoughthank you for the nice review  i saw one at walmart for   you make me what to buy one    one question if you dont mind please  a reviewer at amazon complained that when he was running at one speed then he slowed down or he accelerated this garmin doesnt update right away  it takes minutes for garmin to finally responds and updates  is that truejust got it for like  ok amazon heavily discounted i hope i like it more than my amazfit biphey guys what watch do you use for running and whydoes it receive phone calls and make phone call thanksdoes it show vo maxno stopwatch on a sportswatch wtf good review btwlike me if you dont use a smart phone you can upload to garmins site for info with your computerno stopwatch is a criminal omission i went for the tomtomspark  insteadthe worst fitness watch ever i had this watch for about a year and a half and got extremely frustrated with it especially the heart rate sensor which was the reason i purchased it in the first place i would do a hiit workout in which i could barely breath or keep up and the watch would tell me my heart rate is  bpm sometimes it would jump to bpm maybe a bpm garmin support was not very helpful other than suggesting what i already tried  making the strap tighter clean the sensor shave my arm none of that actually workedneed a better voice mic  found it hard to understand you over the musici couldnt be more disappointed with the product and i have been very loyal to garmin for years every garmin product i have owned has been superbuntil now the heart rate measurement on the forerunner  is pathetic it is woefully inconsistent often inaccurate has frozen during several workouts and is simply not dependable if you row ruck do full body interval circuits etc or anything where you quickly andor frequently move your arms this is the wrong garmin productgarmin should include a big bold italicized and underlined disclaimer in the product description if your workouts are varied and more intense than steady state running our chest strap products will be far more accurate nearly always consistent and far more dependable wristbased heart rate measurement is not as accurate as our chest strap productsdismal keeps switching off to update softwarei have realised that heart rate reading is in big part completely made up by software instead of actual sensor it estimates hr based on movement sensor rubbishdownload linkshttpswwwactivejrcombestgarminwatchfacesgraphomatic is my favorite   its got the weather forecast my heartrate  and either the ambient pressure or elevation   looks simple and nice tooline is a great face i have used it since   i note your face shows no data for the weather  this has only ever worked for a very short time for me and every time the software updates firmware etc it breaks the weather part of the app  if you get it working please let me knowlike them im still on the simple version hi i got a  plus and do not have the watchface that you call the standardi would like to use it  can i get it from anywhere when it is not the standard on my watchthanks a loti use style  by the same author as sc like it very much would be interested in your opinion keep it upi notice a lot of people focusing on the negative or complaining in these comments very sadxface is the best watch face theres no competitionhere we are three years later in  the f is an awesome watch thats still expensive particularly because the fenix  is out even the fenix  is still sold and expensive i just got an f titanim sapphire and its just beautiful and functional im a trail runner so i cant ask for anything bettergreat shots dudetop quality contenti just received the fenix s today like you i cant believe for this price garmin did not add storage to the phone ive gotten use to carrying my phone if i want to listen to music but i would love not to have to carry one more thin when i run thanks for the videonice outdoor shotstobias this is an excellent video and provides a grounded view on the positives as well as the downsides of the fenix the compulsion to be an early adopter and buy this ubercool watch is overwhelming your video seeks to make ppl like me pause think twice and then make an informed decision thanks for sharingwhy would i want the  form fa tor with the  tech its nice to have a larger screennice video subscribedjust got mine on  the best purchase although i paid  on mine for the regular fenix non sapphire version anyways regardless it helped me track everythingi mean everything i lost  lbs so faryes i rum  miles and do hiit every x a dayi only eat less than  calories and i do detox water with apple cider vinegar i refuse to believe everyone that told me i lost weight because i thought they just havent seen me in a while until i look in my scalenot only that this watch kind of reminds me of how hard i work at my job and physically at the gym afterwardslove itwhy would you charge it on your wristyoure bound to the cable cant go anywherenice cool outdoor shots the video is awesomei have fenix x greatactually i dont expect to have music storage for a sport watch only those who want to turn on and tune out will complain about this  when im in nature id rather hear nature  otherwise nice reviewshould i buy a galaxy watch or a fnix s saphire i have a samsung sfenix x is awesomehey man so would you go for the fenix  or the fenix hrgreat video thanks  has helped me make a decision  my wife has the forerunner  which has an absolutely awful screen resolution and put me off garmin  the fenix  is about to release in nz so ill have to check it out   just subscribednice vid brothe mp player is amazingbluetooth signal goes threw my entire house basement and allamazing signaldoes anyone notice that in the fenix  open water the gps distance continues to increase even when you stop swimming in the water it continues to show an increase of about  meter after you stop swimminghey nice review whats the intro tunehi garmin x or apple watch  garmin does make a smaller unit and its called the fenix syou said dust proof yet the specs from garmin say it is nothow long it last before it obsolete it is beautiful but does fitness tracker at this price point is worth it im looking for my first real watch that looks good and tell time at a glance at my wrist and maybe a bit of music control functionif i get a smartwatch like this instead traditional quartz watch fitness is not necessary for me as i think all the number i get from the data wont directly help me i improve my jogging on my own way although i didnt own and experiences any fitness tracker yet do you think fitness tracker make sense and useful for meyou do realize there is a fenix s that is mm and designed for women or people with small wrists so no need to wait for fenix  as you stated in your videoi cant imagine a scenario where you would want to charge the watch while on your wrist loltotally very expensive and the fact they kept wifi away from the regular version is clear miss step on garmin they should include it and upgrade firmwarei have fenix  having gps problems while runningjtour solved all its problems only cost  of itpls stop dropping itlets fet right into it haha typical fucking youtuber linedamn im first name facebought mines now for  secondhand mint condition

and have been loving it since day   for me the wrist heart rate sensor was not too accurate while i was hiking at times will likely do the same hike with my chest strap and compareliked and subscribed

a bit late as usual for me but im really looking forward to it itll defo be an upgrade and a half from the forerunner  that im currently wearing ill let you know my thoughts in a weekthis video glorified this watch to the max loved itlove your review thank you whats the wifi function on the watch for fenix  and s doesnt have wifi only x has itenjoy your videoclearly help and  complete informationvery informative thankyou all the deets i needed to knowive had the sapphire a few months now no regretswhat you recommend fenix over apple series  hey nice video i just have one q the buttons are clicky or are pushers like casiogreat reviewexcellent review thank youbest  review in youtubefound a new sapphire version for tax and shipping for  total i think thats a fair pricebeen into fitness for decades looking forward to using this watch take a break from charging it all the time looking at you galaxy  instead of the ridiculous company made ninetynineninetynine repeated over and over to fool customers just stay the price as it is  dollars plus tax or  plus taxgreat videosubscribedbeaitiful videois it worth buying even nowie april  sae this in the store today and thought that may be this model may be in for an update what say youthankscan some of those other screens be turned off if not wanted or needed i just want a watch with a compass on it dont need or want all the other screensbest review thankshow long it last before it obsolete it is beautiful but does fitness tracker at this price point is worth it im looking for a watch that looks good and tell time at a glance at my wrist and maybe a bit of music control function fitness is not necessary for me as i think all the number i get from the data wont directly help me i improve my jogging on my own way although i didnt own and experiences any fitness tracker yet do you think fitness tracker make sense and useful for methe tracking is so precise that it even konws which side of the street im on gps shows him flying over roads and across the river in a straight line lol great video thoughwill this garmin watch play music from your wrist to a bluetooth speaker or head phoneis it safe to swim with this watch for  days a week cause fitbit charge  didn t last more that a month after i used it for swimminggarmin site says that the fenix  has stress tracking and rep counting can you add some clarity on this in your reviewdid you say it will not pick up hr if sweatinghi great review it seems there are so many reviews on all the fenix  models ive just bought a quatix  sapphire and cant find any quality tutorials or reviews just  unboxing vid some please review the quatix if garmin made a watch that looks the same but with  a third of the functions less thick and cheaper i would buy it for surecringed when you put the watch face down on a tilemarblegranite surface to plug it it  this will scratch the bezel if you continuecan make calls or receive calls reply messages curb your enthusiasmyou reviewing a watch for sports that it doesnt seem like you participated so what value is there in your opinionheard that the watch was really inacurateis it good for pilotswhen you buy any garmin productsknow that it is their policy not to change rechargeable  batteries instead they will ask to pay  of the original price to get a refurbished unitif you are used to something like an apple watch or an android then get ready for an ergonomic nightmarewhat about the dissapointing gps accuracy i mean its reaaaaly bad so muchs so that they should recall the producttoo bad that after  years the watch is not good anymore no replaceable battery available for thisits funny you dont mention that you cant replace the batteryhang on did you say the heart rate monitor will not work if your sweating so not good for a work out lol mins sec into videoyeah whats it do num nutsjust got mine for what do u get when u spend  on a watch nice packaging lolx solar is now the beast this one looks like a joke years old  still better than apple  stupid watchtoo pricyneed to learn how to wear a watch properlysport watch you know not everyone is training for the olympics why are all these watches made for fitness freaksjust awful watch nothing more is it worth buying in  or should i go for a newer modeldidnt get to see the map on thisdopo  anni i contatti della ricarica sono logori non

awesome video thanks to both you guys for the great reviews you do great review i wish there were more of these that are detailed and fair thumbs upgreat overview and totally agree on the comments dcr made about the fr really disappointed in garmin that some of the features like pacepro of the x watches are not introduced on the thanks for posting i watched this as a reference for buying one as for my parentsgreat collabepic just watched it again as i wait for your  editiongood collaboration guysenjoyed the review as always guysi am actively looking for a new great watch  being  an avid suunto fan i recently sold my watch because the new software is lackluster  suunto needs to fix that  so right now im rocking an old polar v and would really like to upgrade but i am just not feeling the new watches yet  keep the reviews coming  ill know the right watch when i see itgreat review if given these data points as most important in orderhrcaloriesgpssleep trackingwhats your best watchgreat to see my two favourite reviewers in one space great stuffhello do you plan to review the vivomove style i would like to know how it handles the gym i have a vivosport and if i am doing anything other than running reads a heart rate close to my restinggreat recap of the year guys k for the box set really its crazy money better spent on a mechanical watch that will hold there value and even increase in value i love my garmin but lets be real there going to be out of date in  years technically anyways so do you guys think the  will be updated anytime soon one final question what watches were you guys wearing in this video look like garmins not sure of the models thanks guys im a subscriber to both of your channelsi like how the fitbit versa  was a more throughout redesign compared to the versa  but didnt get reviewed but the apple series  gets reviewed despite adding less features and using the same designfantastic review so did apple really fix the heart rate issue in series  and when exactlya fancy card signed by a fancy dude sign me upgreat overview of  guys looking forward to watch your swim  review desawesome video thanks guys great review as alwaysfound this channel because i was looking for apple watch reviews love your stuff mategreat overviewa list of watchesbands than can broadcast with bleant for zwift would be my dream d so hard to figure out on some of themtwo of my favorite reviewers in the same video amazing ive died and gone to heavenquality video gentlemenwhen will you do a review on the vivoactive thanks for the reviews i am looking for a better and reliable sports watch this is very helpful great video thank you gentsgreat video enjoyed the comparison and loved seeing both you guys in the same review one question is the garmin instinct not in line with these watches i just bought one and am liking it so fargreat reviews des  ray given the choice would be good to know your  daily driver too shane tooyou guys are amazing immensely high quality content bravowill you do a direct comparison between the galaxy watch active  and apple watch series and perhaps some other smartwatcheswhen will your review on garmin venu come im looking to purchase it  would be nice to have a review from you firstamazing video i am in a pickle to either get garmin venu or an apple watch i am trying to get active but i love to have a lot of metricswho would have known this collab was in the worksgreat collabalso im interested to know where you think the xt now sits in garmins lineup considering they still list it as a current model on their site does something like the  really offer enough to justify the jump in price or upgrading especially as the xt can be found with some great deals these daysgreat summary gentscant wait for the  edition would be nice to see a review of the wear os watches like fossil gen got the marq athlete and i am happy with it i bought it becaus i like the look more it fits perfect for sport but also for the officeabout screens  i had the opposite reaction coming from a galaxy watch to a garmin transflective display i thought this is so nice and i love it i hope they keep a transflective options going forwardgod ive been looking for a video like this one thank you guysi just came here to hit the like button as fast as possibleray is such a nice guythis was awesomepolar vantage best for indoor swimming excellent hr functionality and battery lifegood onehard to beat garmin for all day use have many diffrent watches and most things you needif they could make the design more like my icebreaker thoprice is maybe to high but around here it always is and my icebreaker was like  less than my x sapphire i do notice icebreaker this days is same price as the other coros thoi think its hard to beat the m for an incredible all round package only thing missing is barometer for recording ascentdescent betrer other than that its excellentgreat video loved your camaraderie and of course the content one question though on your comment on venu wondering how you managed to eke out  days of battery life after  weeks with it i just cant seem to get more than  days  any tipswhat do you recommend for mostly road cycling and maybe a little running in the future for under i am proud owner and user of a polar vantage m i tend to get tempted getting a garmin i earlier died for the fenix line  now well i think the fr is the best watch looking at features and price  i wish it was tiny bit bigger after watching many videos like this the vantage m is absolutely not that bad at allgreat videoive been with polar for many years my most recent is the m and m i use hr strap the h anyway but at the gym its nice to use the wrist base sensor and notifications features of the m my recent problems with the wear os and my iphone x ive also been an iphone user for many years tooso now im considering either change phones to an android wear samsung or other android smart phone or change watches to an apple  or  so it plays nicely with my iphonesdo apple watches have the ability to use a hr strap like a h bt strap apple is obviously its not going to use antgreat videoist a great video thank you so much i know i have a problem i own more than a few of these  great summaryi really love my vivoactive you should take some pointers and structure this like mkbhds smartphone of the year awards it would be cool to give awards for different categoriesi clicked like before even watching as both premier sport watch reviewers in the same videogot the garmin venu love the screen had a fenix  before but was hard to see sometimes and very bulky happy to wear venu at work and in the gym if i ever go to the gym that iswhich one would you say is the most accurate in measuring heart rate throughout the day accuracy is most important to me not interested in apple and wrist onlyhey just searching for the best watch for myself i thing garmin venu is the best solution for me just between smart watch and sportwatch is ray from dc rainman just wearing one right now it is a tip for me as well  many thanks for that videogreat collab guys however i dont understand why you dont seem to review amazfit devices amazfit bip amazfit stratos  and so on these devices are very popular in the budget fitness watch sector would it be possible for you to start noticing amazfit  they are here to staycompared to other garmin polar sport watches which one would you definetely recommend for runners in a range of  by the way u are the best sport reviewersthank u lotslove this what watch is ray wearing in the reviewray hit the nail on the head  coros main competitive advantage is battery life  if garmin could find a way to mimic it or make their solar power watches affordable coros would be squashedi still reeeaaaally love my fenix x not the plus i think ill wait until fenix  or  to upgradeim garmin fan but battery does matter for me as i always go for ultra so vertix for me already bought for  days battery life was amazinghiwhich model workout heart rate moniter more stable and accuratenice videoi do have questionwhat smart watch do recommend for bike only activity as thats main thing i like use and good heart monitor but i like maps on it toand as in budget rangeso great videosi think this is great  can you please place stats on a legend superimpose to the left or right faq data about what you are talking about  someone below indicates the time of the video per modelthere is video editing software you can do that and help people who cant hear or perhaps are at work perhaps a comparison chart of features of all watches in a full side by side comparison use all known smartwatch features in a grid then layout price model etchi des i really want to know which sportsmart watch you use daily please lolwhat watches in the near future are going to incorporate  all the sport activities including a dive computer within the same unit which watch should i choose i need accurate sleep blood oxygen info heart rate tracking basically all health areas possible in a watch which watch is best for thisi am consfused in between garmin vivo active  vs galaxy active  along with running i also play tennis regularly so please suggest watch that has tennis mode in itplease review huawei gt in the futurefor a value phone is the garmin  too old tech looming to use primarily for occasional road bike use and gymhi there great video much appreciated just wondering when do u think the new garmin fenix watch coming out in other words is fenix  still a good purchase in fall  for a high end sports watch thanksawesome introi switched apps from fitbit to s health when google bought fitbit s health isnt bad at all imogot my vivoactive  todayhi i used   and edge  for mtb  i saved up and upgraded to fenix x and loved the training status and vo max recovery time  since covid   ive taken to trail running and all my training status has gone i get a message run twice outdoors with a heart rate to see your status does this mean none of these functions work only on flat roads or track running is the fenix  the same excellent video as always the other guy is not bad eitherafter looking at all these watches i still think i want my next watch to get the garmin instinctfenix  have way superior battery and gps compared to fenix  for us hikers thats a big positive for those who are on the fence about the fenix  solar heres the deal are you someone who use all the functions of the watch music games phone notifications all the sensors  if so then solar is irrelevant because its a matter of gaining an hour or so on the other hand if youre someone who primarily use a watch as a watch if you go for a longdistance hike with barely any functions beside hourly tracking then this watch is excellent on expeditionary mode solar will extend your battery life with an extra ive bought four sets what you guys are crazy richmade the decision to leave apple as a fitness watch  seems like the cycling function works well on all products  swimming is critical looking for durability and data on swimming and of course a low cost point  any recommendationsgarmin fenix s died on moterosa sky marathon after  months of use i am on suunto nowim getting a venu in another week or so i wanted a  but it was bit out of my budget decision to get venu was based on rainmaker review i read couple of days agojust going to make a cofee tighten up my vantage and start to watch ill share my experience if someone out there is looking to buy suunto watchesi had a garmin fenix  hr sapphire and thus i had a great software backing the watch software that both reads and writes to strava and keeps track of your resting heartrate and everything you doi bought the suunto  baro a beautifull watch but with software that doesnt even come close to garmin connectim missing a lot of features especially the feature for suunto to read strava workouts and incorporate it into the suunto app for a complete overview aswell as the watch actually reading whats in the appas of right now i record all my workouts in zwift during snowseason and none of these end up in the suunto app i have to pay for a service that does it for mebut they still dont end up on the watch so when i look at my watch it doesnt give me correct readings for stress and overall fitness scorethe watches from suunto are superb the software is but a shell of what it could beif you want great software aswell buy something elseis spedition included in the    boxdes  do you wear the  or the x  also  what activity would you recommend for rebounding mini trampoline  cheershey nice reviews watched lots of your videos but cant seem to get my mind on one choice  i mainly do weight lifting and circuit training whats is the best watch for this type of training  i do own a iphone but im not the kind of guy to only buy apple stuff  saw suunto and polar and i kinda like these too  is my best bet the apple watch   man im kinda lost  plz plz help mei thought for sure tomtom cardio spark  was going to be a game changer i still wear it after buying it the first year it came out but its definitely showing its age takes forever to connect to gps takes forever to sync with my phone after completing a workout online support is going away havent been an update for the app in months so rip cardio spark  wmusicim looking for moderate active life most of my exercises are gonna be pool swimming and gym workout wanna have access to music and monitor my daily wellbeing especially stress levelcan i have top  recommendation pleaseyou guys have access to all of these which one day in and day out for personal use when you are not testingreviewing is on your wristthe way that tape measure is mounted on that wall is bugging be hell out of megetting the  december th hi thank you for this review you guys are definitely the best out there if i can add something i was expecting a bit more details on the fenix  it did have few new features that were ported to the  at later stage i am using the fenix  x for a while now and for my surprise some features are just useless like the body battery works only if you wear the watch during the sleep otherwise just gives some random results based mostly on the time you set for sleeping hours what is most annoying though i am training mostly indoor on the treadmill because of the weather and for my surprise all the sport features like vomax  lactate threshold  training status do not work according to the watch i am not training at all even if i ran km these week very disappointingbest intro everi have the vivoactive  and i must say that i am disappointed in the battery life claimed vs reality then when i talk to the people at the store they say oh you must switch the bluetooth off and switch off the backlight and switch off the heart rate monitoring and switch off the blah blah blah well then i may as well buy a blooming normal watch as with everything i switch off to save battery life i lose part of why i bought the blasted thing heck i may as well keep the watch off and only switch it on when i want to see the time  im sure ill get great battery life then im not a massive fitness fanatic but love these watches for step tracking heart rate and built in gps but boy oh boy id love to get the advertised battery live  so now im thinking of getting a garmin fenix  just so that i dont have to stress about chargers when i go overseas for a week or into the bush for a week is that too much to askim looking into smart watchfitness tracker dont have a big budget id like to know your opinions on the amazon watches under  australiani just bought a watch from  polar m incoming to help me keep track of my training the price of this tech had dropped to  eur and it seems to tick the boxes for mei just watched this and i dont even wear watchesas a galaxy note  owner i was really hoping for a slam dunk with the active  sadly it appears the hr tracking is not the most consistent thinking about picking up an iphone just so i can use an apple watch and have a more consistent experiencewhich watch would you pick if you had  to  hundred dollars to spend for fitness and smart notificationsi wished you guys pointed out which ones you both were wearing during the review that was kind of likedrop the ball moment ijsiam debating between garmine  and polar vantage m any help or opinionscongrats for the vdeos at same price m or m thankshey question im working out and my coach recommends to buy a sports watch that measures my rest sleep stress and heart rate she recommend the polar brand special de ignite is this something you would also recommend i also came across the polar vintage m polar vintage v samsung active  and the garmin  what would you recommendim a little bit confused here i initially thought that the vivoactive  was the winner given the longer battery life given the fact garmin didnt utilize the oled display as much i got that impression from rays review as well however here you both seemed to be leaning more towards the venu please advise im buying one the weekdes  looking to replace an old forerunner   i am trying to stay in the  range  i was looking at the garmin  maybe  on sale or the coros pace  mostly trail running then mtn bike and road bike secondary  any thoughts between those  or should i look at others  just down i from you in co spgs garmin deltascharlybravo tactix are missingit sounds like  is the best watch as far as i can tell if budget is not an issue what would you recommend especially for running i want as many features as possible does it make sense to wait a bit for another model a bit surprised with coros feedback but it does sound fairreally like both of these guys videos but find it weird they never talk about how bad garmin is at sleep tracking had the venu for over a month and really loved it but the sleep tracking was so useless i decided to return it focusing on fitness aspects is fine but sleeprecovery is also important imoif you like this video youll love our new podcast weve extended our yearend chats to a regular ongoing podcast where we chat about all things sports tech including smartwatches sportswatches bike computers bike trainers trainer apps and anything sports tech related  httpswwwyoutubecomthefitfilewhich watch do you recommend as far as fitness tracking like most accurate heart rate reading calories burned but also has smart watch featuresdesfitim looking to upgrade my vivoactive  music as im starting with triatlon i would want a watch that does these things multisport navigation i want to do some trailruns and musicam i right that only garmin has a few watches that combines them all and if so why arent there any brands that combine these and if so why do other brands hate music suunto coros im looking at youbest videomr rainmaker is truly a databank easygoing one thing though what are you guys wearing on your wristsit is hard for me to think of an apple watch as a good runningsports watch  i view an apple watch as a smart watch that can do sports functions while a garmin fenix  for example is a runningsports watch that can do smart watch functions  if i want a smart watch apple it is  if i want a runningsports watch garmin it is  as cool as an apple watch is how well will it do at a spartan or tough mudder  even just a trail the spartan va trail at one point i was waist deep in water and the garmin took a few hits  how well would the apple hold up  each has their own nichewhere do we get that awesome christmas tshirthard sell for the swim  when garmin are heavily discounting the xt these dayswhats your daily watch that you wear maybe you could also test the huawei watch gt that would be great i do swimming gym and walking for me the watchs most important features are sleep control pedometer and batterylife what do you recommend i have a huawei p hey guys why dont you test the amazfit stratos  i think feature wise its a good dealbetter crossover since avengershi guys which watch would you recommend for some who wants to improve their fitnessstrength mainly road cycles in a low elevation area but rarely runsswims with a budget of as for me polar vantage v is the best one for running and checking my healtha comment to your note at  are you sure the  uses its own special charger i use the  and purchased additional chargers  data cables that are sold on ebay as compatible to      xt g during the purchase you cant even select a specific one of these models i received the chargers today and they work just fine on the   for charging and data transferdefinitely not a fan of oled displays hope garmin will stay away from them the trans reflective displays are awesome and much more practical awesome video with you two pairing upis dc rocking the vivoactive  in this vid he seemed to not like it in his write up so this is interesting wtf i came back to back to back st it what is the best for swimming  both pool and open waterwhich do you think is the better watch galaxy active  or the garmin vivoactive you didnt mention what you guys were actually wearing  can you tell us pleasewhere would you recommend to buy a fitness watch ive seen great deals at like gps nation or planet cyclery online are places like these trustworthy thanks love the vid no mention of the instinct or did i missi would be nice if you guys told your viewers which watches you are wearing in addition to the overall  presentationplease what watches are you both wearing thankswhich watch do you both wearim missing  the polar vantage in this lineupwoooooooooohooowwreally can not understand what is the point of having something if its not precise regarding to what you said about garmin swim  and its wrist heart rate accuracy why would anyone want their approximate hr if i wanted that i wouldnt be buying the watch i could measure it every now and then on my rest time if someone has an explanation feel free to let me know all the bestdo you ever test amzfit stratoswhat watchs are you guys both wearing in the videocan these watches be used on running or swimming or whatever you do without any connection with smartphonesso what are your top  allaround watch picksgreat video  really helpful as always  i noticed that you criticised coros pricing and i think one of the relatively cheap polar models but why do you never criticise garmin who make maybe the most overpriced products in the entire world  the forerunner  costs  in australia which is outrageous and these arent oldschool  luxury watches the type that last forever and get handed down to the next generation  they only last a few years typically  and while their watches usually do have some impressive features they are almost always disappointingly way behind the times for certain basic features  how long did we have to wait for music  and it was rubbish when it first arrived  only recently have they added streaming  the xt which isnt all that long gone couldnt even double as an everyday wrist watch which was soooo dumb  and dont get me started on the early versions of garmin pedals come on guys  its  whats the saying about putting a man on the moon someone needs to stick up for all of us who arent in a position to do so  if they cut all their prices in half across the board then maybe theyd be approaching fairness  maybeanyhoo i love that you are doing your best to keep us up to date on all the alternatives  love your workthe first time ever i have heard someone say i thought this watch band was horrifying and his counterpart say it was indeed horrific  funny shitwhats your daily driveri use to have a digital watch that would unclip from the band and transform into a robot like a gobot i think thats the last watch ive ownedwhat watches are you two wearing in this videobut where did dcrainmaker get that shirthuawei gt and gt is best priceperformace and probably best looking devicecoros pace is the must goooooooo do they ever say which are their personal favorite in any videoyou should put the name of the item you are talking about up on the screenwhat kinda watch you both guys are wearnig and which one do you think is the best and whypolar vwhat models of watch you are wearing herei got garmin and its perfect watch except sleeping tracking is rubbish no where near fitbit they should work more on sleeping modeamazfit stratos  is missing i did  triathlons with it and i am amazed check it outwhere i can get that xmas tshirt dbarley even mentioned the the venu is an excellent watch with a beautiful display that garmin unfortunately doesnt take advantage of the  garmin ecosystem in and of itself is limited few watch faces are available to really show off that screen and even fewer apps in the end smart watch makers will catch up with the fitness tracking capabilities of companies like garmin and theyll have the ecosystem to keep their audience involved i mean garmin doesnt even have a calculator app that    is usable for the venuor a map to use the gps you could argue that its a new direction for garmin give it time but at the price point theyre asking i doubt many will be convinced to make the initial purchasenot when you have other watches with more support that do the same thing not to mention theyre competing against themselves with the vivoactive theyre all priced the same for the holidays  hey des didnt you guys forget about wear os  they have the fossil sport or the puma sport after all i think its telling that not one of the watches on this list is wear os maybe with the fitbit acquisition something will happen but its very doubtful they all have terrible hardware and google fit is an absolute mess nice review though happy holidayswe want a review about rays tshirtwhat about sunnto watchesgreat videoyou two are my references what about the huawei watch gt im deciding between  and  music ive heard some rumours that the barometer is kinda bad and doesnt really matter if you upload your runs to strava anyway  the metal bezel also might give weaker bluetooth signal with earbuds what you guys thinkwhat kind of watch is rainmaker wearinggood review but more watches shots rather than lecturers shotsalso timecodes would be appreciatedand nothing from amazfit sad should have had the stratos  and even maybe the stratos  in there and the amazfit trexwhat watches were you wearingmost of these watches look cheap and like prototypes some look quite similar to the  bucks polar pulse watch i bought  years ago i believe we are now in the sportswatch era comparable to the mobile phone era when they looked like bricks the only watch i would love to wear all the time is the marq captain but im not paying  euros for a watch that i might be able to use for  or  years a classic watch for  bucks i can wear for the rest of my life and then my son can wear it for the rest of his life as long as we are at this stage i will pay maximum  euros its  to  euros pers year for an item you throw away at some point and thats fine thanks for the comparisonno polar vantage vpolar vantagei dont think ive seen a review of a tactix charlie from either of you guys any chancewheres the huawei gt which watches you have on your wriststhe million dollar question is what watch is each one of these guys wearing in the videooled display with week battery is one thing but it must be always on otherwise ill stick to vivoactive  thank youit seems as if these high end smartwatches have problems with accurate readings can anyone help me find a cheaperaccurate smartwatch that tracks calories burnt when running and biking possibly a gps and heart rate monitor included although not essentialinstinctwhich is the winner guys the video is too longyou guys kind of flubbed the fitbit versa  review for other watches you go into whats good whats not etc all you said about the fitbit was that it added voice functionality and an always on display while you praised the ionic the ionic has a gps and the versa doesntthats the difference you seem pretty inconsistent in your comparisonshuawei watch gtgreat videoi disagree with amoled  going to be the future of garmin displays i hope garmin keeps their highend sport devices away from amoled nice to look at should never be at the cost of function and performance  outdoor and direct sunlight performance amoled may get close on full brightness but it cannot compete with displays that can work with sunlight not against it battery impact a display that is functional and have less impact on battery should always be preferred on an outdoor sport purpose device  touch interface absolutely hate touch interface with a passion when you are out in below freezing environments  you can still use buttons with a mitten or thick glove on your hands try that on a shitty touch screen interfacewho is  for youis this a advertisement for garmin why not show the pilar vantage v titan  garmin sleep works while sitting in the kitchen drawer over night and gives you rem and deep sleep all while sitting in the kitchen drawerthe marc collection for when you need to drive your ferrari to the airport to fly your helicopter out to your yachtas an owner of the garmin  im super annoyed that its been left behind vs the  and  for running features like pace propoor show on garmins sidelol on sleepy  fitbit same here  the only thing i hate on garmin for is that they have no buyback or recycling program yet they release a ridiculous amount of watches with both superfluous and confusing features there must be a land fill in africa full of these thingswasnt it apple that charged k for their first apple watch k for five with a nice box sounds like a dealwow fitbits dont qualify as a sports watch anymorei got the v for couple of years now i would love to upgrade but got zero budget so this is just a sport watch porn for meno garmin instinct here unfortunatelyhow could they all suckhi im new in running is the vivoactive  is good for the first timer like me thank you sir desfit and dc god bless merry christmasgarmin swim  still a watchcome on guys so which one was your favoritegarmin vivoactive  musici am still confused and cant decide fx  amazing look and also top price has maps and great battery life but too heavyweight so wanna maps and light weight fr oh but that ugly design or wanna light weight and great battery life and nice design there is coros great but i really that type of tradition and quality over the years with rich data collection in app and website so polar grit x dont know you tell me i will lose maps but for good price i will have nice design and good battery life with acceptable weight q but is polar grit x better running watch than fri dont think people are really seeing the potential of including pulseox you can manipulate your breathing to to change your oxygen saturation thus mimicking altitude training if this could be broadcast on to your training app so you can see it would help my training to no endamazfit watch batre live bestapple denying the heart rate issues for months before fixing them is exactly the reason i wouldnt buy from themare amazfit watches good for fitnessi thought that pon wasnt allowed on youtube watchespsshhmust be made out of metamaterials from a recovered ufoi like the apple watch but you need an iphonegarmin x shappire to rule them allrather boring i wish you would focus more on the software than the hardware the garmin watches are still light years behind where they should be building products with  separate teams watch connectcom connect app is an absolute disaster theyve never understood the needs of a multisport athlete they just dont have an eye for any detail its very unpolished work you ever notice the running man animation on the connect app  its very juvenile the back upper arm actually pokes up under the head when it should be hidden theres a ton of issues with how they track mileage everything goes through the cloud but the cloud does no error detection the biggest thing is they cant do what they say they can to with the training statusv because theyre so volatile on false reading which will happen with ohr totally throughs everything nuts for example my v max has dropped from a  to a  in the corse of one week on a fenix  is that physically possible for body to go to crap like that also note the fudging of numbers garmin has been doing if you use the chest strap for you running youll notice they rolled out an update around january from that point on youll see a lot more  lr foot balance scores prior to this it wasnt out of the norm to get  score which is impossible most importantly on a running aspect they lack a lot of basic features that would make the user experience much greater example the new features the rolled out in the connect app last week where the lap view has more features with your programmed workout as well as the main synopsis page giving an interval time an average omitting warm up and cool downsok do not buy galaxy watch series if youre runner or cyclistive been using  type of galaxy series and it sucksthere is no huawei gt a pity max is all i am willing to pay to put these hunk of junks on my wrist sportswatches and no comment on anything mechanical  all of these are disposable plastic crapif you look at the entire range of super fancy and expensive watches all those watches do not do much more than look fancy and act as expensive jewelry for mostly manly mengarmin is going after that ultrarich manly man who does in fact collect watches and there are men who fit that profile garmin understands that that sort of man doesnt care is anything make sense or not those guys will just need to spend their thousands and thousands of dollars on whatever just because they canhey folks  heres the link to the full post with all the accuracy testing and piles of galleries of photos of all the watches enjoy httpsdcrainmarqnice suit but i bet you have your bike shorts on being a longtime garmin watch and ecosystem user i just got myself the avitator as a replacement for a  ray might not be the targeted client but i am daily driver was either that  or my a lange  shne and a few other dresssport watches which all looks nice but doesnt provide any physiological measurements between training sessions with the aviator i can now wear something that looks somewhat decent rolex gmt clone with a suit and have  data and the price is something i can absorb anywaylove this channel and the time it takes to do the extensive online reviews must be immense great stuff looking forward to seeing more stuff from you subbedat those prices i guess their new slogan is fleecing the marqlove the suit and tie ray and congrats on the subscriber milestoneyour reviews are impressive very very well done im part of the family now keep it upheart in mouth every time that stand wobblesbeen rocking the marq adventurer for over  months now its my favorite watch in general now i liked my vivoactive but this thing has more battery a better sapphire screen and tons of more features yeah it cost a lot more but it has a lot of premium physical features like the leather band sapphire glass that stuff costs money even in a traditional watchloving the suit  looking good rayim glad you talked about price no one else is talking about price and that makes you stand out of all the other garmin review videos i think its important to talk about how fast this tech will go obsolete the prices are incredibly high and the watches will become previous models within the next  days theyre coming out with new watches every year we dont have  to drop every year or the other garmin needs to recycle their older pieces and give a good rebate on their new watchesthanks for the quick upload and great takesreally like the expedition but couldnt justify the price im considering the x that comes with the official leather strap in the box do you have any pictures of that one or a review its difficult to quite see the colours on the garmin site thankslove or hate the watches the review was great nobody needs a watch like this like i dont need my tesla apple and now garmin has determined there is a significant market for things people dont need if you need a watch like this you probably need way more expensive things like a plane or a yacht i think findmyyachtplane is now in the app store its a free appthanks for all the reviews and tests you are the best in this hi do you know if the golf functions are the same on all devices i love the look of the aviator gen but dont want to loose function on the golf gen fantast review would have liked to watched your longer versionim looking to purchase the marq athlete question should i or just purchase the fenix  plusthese are tools guy i categorically wanted a higher end lux styled watch to do my running glad these came out it is to be used and enjoyedupvoted just for the rays the steaks referencegreat review keep up the good work forerunner  tri for daily wear and sports omega for elegant occasions cant beat that combo hard to beat a bit of honesty hey does the price gives more advantage on battery liferay garmin just released the commander edition for the marq series an update to this channel loving the new mic how many of the widget changes will make it onto the current fenix and forerunner  seriesnice suit raylooking sharpthat is a beautiful watchthx for the review im a fenx user i think they miss the mark on this series athletes want features and functionality but i understand there is a market for this niche group and i would love to see the sales next yearlooking sharp boss is this also the new op that we will see on the fenix watchesthanks  i trust your reviews on garmin from past experience and it does not bode well if the gps chip is not that great on such an expensive watch  i like the look of it thoughsuch an insane pricei love my fenix x sapphire but i drool over these marq series watches if i had the coin i would buy one even though the tech would be outdated in a few yearslove your hard work man any feelings of the opitcal heart rate changes is it better than the laggyish  series my apple watch series  put the garmin i had to shame with hr accuracy but i cant use the apple watch for long the battery doesnt make it with the training i do im hoping they will trickle the new hr monitor design down into cheaper watches if its better ill wait if its not no point in waitingi enjoy your videos  i have owned a garmin products since   your point about the lifetime of these watches is a great one  the batteries dont last more than  years and replacing them is not worth the cost  you may as well get a new one  however i have found polar to have a better battery  it has certainly lasted longerproper sales manthe marq seems to be a plus with pulse ox added why do you think the battery life in smart watch mode is  days while the pro is  days do they both have the sony gpsive got several garmin devices now  my daily wear is a va  i use it to track general workouts running biking but i also use its golf features pretty extensively  they just released the marq golfer which has some really compelling features without taking away the activity stuff i want like the approach series does  but at  that is a pill im not willing to swallow  i would however give it a second look if the screen were improved over the va which from reading the comments and watching the video does not seem to be the case  i definitely do not want amoled but at the very least resolution needs to be improved on their screens to ask this much moneygoodluck at your highschool prom with that suit ray i even dont dare to upgrade from my well functioning fenix  because of all the issues with the newer devices reported in forums although i would like to have maps priority for me as probably for many others is gpsaccuracy so i agree that real sports guys are not the target grouphows the screen resolution  i had the chronos and ended up returning it after a month because it was so difficult to readexpeditions mode would be relevant if it was posibel to adjust the gps record and turn the on and of and have abc as welltwo weeks would be sufficient for most with low battery use gps and abccan they each do the functions of each other example i like the look of the aviator but need the driver and expedition functions i personally use a x plus for motorcycle touring adventuresmaps with bluetooth directions fitness and i do own a race car if they are only for each watches nameaviator cant do drivers functions then which one fits methis is more of an exercise in branding and positioning than it is a nearterm drive for profit it will be interesting to see how marq evolves and if it provides more pricing headroom for the lowerend lines by the way how was the tactile feel of the buttonsgreat video thank you for it do you think the garmin fenix  will come out in  thank youhey dc why would it be obsolete if it is charged it will run right its just not up to date with the newest softwareor do you think otherwisei felt so guilty about buying a fenix  plus for  cad even the entry level one in here will cost  cad so the athletic version will cost  more for design ui changes and some firstbeat analyticsis the black hybrid titanium driver edition wirstband compatible with a normal fenixis this like a fenix x but in a fancy suitany word on how much of these features theyre going to backport to the fenix  seriesgood news of this collection is that some of this magic will trickle down to the fenix at some point in time the athlete is not that much more expensive in some regions than the sapphire fenixs after release date question is who will want to beat up their k wristwatches without a single worry interesting evolution nonetheless thanks for the detailed overview as alwayshi raythanks for the reviews i went on garmin website and seen that they have a scuba diving smart watch im a scuba diver and use a dive computer is there anyway you can do a review on the scuba diving one thankswill we see some of that trickle down to the imagine doing a triathloncycling while wearing one then your tire snags a rock or a stick you fall off and smash your  watch no thank you my garmin xt is all i needwill be interested to see how the watch does in open water swimwhich is best the marq commander or the tactix  prowhat type of display is used how many colorsnice video only thing i dont like is the overhead camera feels like it faces the wrong way i dont know why but my brain expects it to be overhead and from your side of the table overall though great content thanksid buy an american made music man stingray which will work perfectly for decades to come and hold value really well a forerunner  suits me just fine thank youthose watches will become obsolete in few years  but my fathers ambit  that i use for gps with hr strap is still perfectly fine d nothing obsolete in what it isany chance they will launch a golf version for a smart watch is the most you should pay not a million dollars  hahahahahnice production touch with the suit i see the point about tech moving on but a camera and a phone are totally different when it comes to consumers buying but how i am looking at it why buy these when you can get more or less the same functionality with a fenix x plus for a lot less for the athlete edition anywayyou only have to look an example of this with the iphone xr and xs the xr offers more or less the same functionality at a reduced price and its a top seller for apple according to the analystsas a consumer i buy lots of tech some of it is a need and some is a want i also have a nice collection of high end watches but i am not tempted to even consider this watch even though i do own the dlc fenix x plusmy final point apple tried this with both the edition gold range and recently the ceramic edition despite all of apples pulp and marketing the company has given up again on the luxury linehi ray i have seen the marq aviator rrp  for  i was going for a fenix  but in your opinion  at this discounted price is it worth going for the aviator even if i wont use the aviation featureshows this compare to the fenix  line up at this pointnot wanting to be nitpicking but the moving map in the background at  is moving the wrong way earth spins the other directionif earth spun like this then sunrise would be in the west and sunset would be in the eastim new to buying these smartwatches im a pool and open water swimmer would it be wise for me to buy considering if outdated soon the garmin xt in  or go with recent garmin  thankssurprising lack of footage of the watchessome mixed emotions here i kind of like the way garmin is going here but they need to upgrade the display i would like to se a higher resolution and maybe som real hands kind of like the vivomove hr that would make it more classythe delta  px is about   the aviator marq is almost double  whats the difference between the  and how does garmin justify the price increase is there any way to remove golf from a garmin descent mkwhat based on the  when there is a  doesnt make much senseyeah i love garmin watches better than any other sport watch out there  and dont even mind spending  on it  but one of the important things for me is weight  lighter is better  i dont want the watch weighing me down  the marq athlete misses the mark on weight  put all that tech in the new forerunner  and you got yourself another best seller garmingarmin marqledi will have a hard time buying another garmin gps watch i am on my rd fenix three sapphire due to various issues with them just flat not doing what garmin says they are supposed to purchased a fenix  for my wife christmas before last and it also has some issues with altimeterbarometer just hard to keep giving them money for things that dont work as advertised something happened witht the soundnew charging portnice look in suit maybe unbutton the jacket sitting downgreat walkthrough as alwaysrainmaker  love your stuff especially the website which has been my goto place for years about this watch series  just my opinion but this is rubbish the price does not even come close to justifying what utility you actually get out of the watch i am a longtime garmin user starting with the xt ugly by todays standards  then the xt i then moved on to the original fenix then the fenix  i stopped there because i could not see the purchase of the fenix  as being justified this now is simply outrageousness the athlete and the adventurer edition are obsolete already the fenix  plus range has the same software  functionality the only real difference is the build quality but not worh the price difference imhopissed still tempted hald price pricewhy should i get this watchmy god you might as well have published a harry potter novel with how long that post lookedvideo starts at if the gps in this watch turns out to have gps issues its a no go no matter what the price isperfect analysis of its limited lifetrue i rather buy a tag heuerno mention anywhere about the water resistance rating  thats  a very important thing to overlook  is is  atm   garmin doesnt show it on their website and your everything you will ever need to know post also contains zero infowhen apple becomes the reasonable better featured affordable optioni wore breitlings for about ten years before i finally switched to fenix  while i appreciate garmin trying to dress up sports watcheswhich are all rather bland and industriali dont see myself getting one of these  no amount of bling even tastefully done on a sports watch will give it the exclusivity and artistic relevance of highend mechanical diving or racing watchesi feel like these marqs are aimed at this awkward middle ground   in the case of practicality my fenix  plus does everything these marq watches do  if someone wants to dress up or show off a rolex omega or breitling will always be more classy and expensive than a garmin k and more smartwatch and the display resolution is just  thats a sad joke it remember me on the first nintendo game boyhm id rather like to see garmin fix their fenix  firmware instead releasing a similar set of watches for  times the price of a  but ya i dont understand business obviouslyso i can understand your stand point on thinking these will not compete with tech in the next  years but youre wrong on them being done and dusted at that point the dentures they offer dont go bad honestly with what they offer there isnt anything else needed from a gps watchkinda disagree with the it will be obsolete in a few years or  years thinking more like  years imo if you are ok with not having some of the latest tech  features but yeah ultimate it is a lot of money and still not going to last very longtheir website i useless  is their any website  that i can compare specs side by sidewould love to see real hand not the horrible dead screens like fitbit apple etci love to always see the onscreen display but garmin have a good comprise at the momentwant high res displays expect poor battery life and no always on screenthe withings sport hr has real hands and battery lasts about  weeks on a single charge but screen is tinyyou really think the tech will be obsolete in a few years garmin hasnt added fundamental new featuressensors in a long timeworth it this watch  off in these new high end crappers are just that all style  no substance even the gps is wonky by all accounts   it seems like ultimate everyday watch  you can use them for training and they dont seem like a sport watch st least on the first sight and  wait  im using forerunner  as the only watch they are in the quite bright blue colour and its totaly alright and they are probably  cheaper than this creature still not solar powered  i just went for a casio rangeman  beautiful display basic nav but main reason  solar powered gps position  garmin are still tied to a flawed display  it may be colour but theres no dynamic rangecontrast  i wonder how long they will continue to milk the cowso i think if garmin want to build a extravagant watch not enough to change a case from plastic to titanium need a better oled display wireless charging min  gb memory this is a simple price tag change nothing morefor that price i would expect the screen quality to be better from the apple watch right now it looks like a potato screen similar to the rest of the garmin watches with a resolution of a xpxi had the finex  i did not like the washed screen and the very inaccurate heart rate in what was supposed to be a watch for sports i hope those pricy versions are betterhmm i think garmin missed the mark with this selection tag heuer watch  meid rather see a garmin that is as good as a suuntonever happened yettrouble is garmin are shooting themselves in the foot by making ever increasing expensive watches that are costing more they will end up pricing themselves out of the marketthe apple watch is hopeless unless you have an iphone so if you have to buy an iphone also makes apple also an expensive optionbut i do feel the way garmins prices are going will price themselves out of the marketdo you know what i can buy with that amount of money an apple watch  that works fine and then professional fitness testing and advice at my local university thats far more usefulidk why anyone would spend  on a smart watch like u said they will be obsolete in few years it confuses me when people buy this kind of stuffany body hear kermit the frog good reviewshehe typical garminwhy even botherdo buy  of new things to try out but this one looks okbut far from worth it for the price they takemy galaxy watch active is better firstmade in chinatoo much   its almost like buying a rolexbattery life is still rubbish whether you pay  or ray man time for a new mic or a new audio set upin my opinion the fenix  series are over priced these are ridiculous i certainly wont be getting onei tried the shower trick dont you own an ironnice review  wish i could afford one for the discerning sportsperson who has no concept of value for moneysorry but you are wearing your suit wrongill wait for the chinese knockoffs of theseyuk yuk yuk what are garmin doing with the look of their watches massive detour for this company i feel the athlete model is far too dressy too much bling great review ray but lose the suit  youre more than fine reviewing in sports attireid rather buy a hamilton or tissot automatic watch time piece and its for life i can leave it to my children etcdont waste so much  money in smartwatches i have the fitbit versa and i like it but never spend more than   on smartwatches not worth itway to much talking at the start show the watches while you talk at  least jesustoo much camera on your face its annoying maybe next time itll better if we have more camera time on the review items insteadwatches are like phones now a piece of money sucking deviceand i thought i spent too much on my  garmin  the trouble with smart watches is they depreciate and become obsolete in a few yearscondescending tip of the daythat looks like a two button suit regardless of how many buttons your suit has the bottom button should always remain undone it was placed there for visual balance not functionif youre wearing a double breasted suit its okay to keep the outside lower button done up in a way that wearing double breasted jackets isntif you actually own a double breasted jacket keep it for the extremely unlikely event that they come back into fashion it will save you  spending good money chasing a fashion that your body shape almost certainly will no longer be suited for the threeandahalfminutes that double breasted are actually trendy love your videos mateunacceptable blueish display never a garmin watch again  and still that crappy lcd screen im not moving from my forerunner  until they make a watch with a dcent displayi dont like his early opinion very poor mindsetif i didnt know they cost  i would assume its some cheap watch from walmart for  they look like sht even garmin instinct looks more expensive than thoseyou are not understandable  talk slowerutter waste of moneywhy are you taking about you suit stick with the subject next time i stopped the video at  minutes boringgarmin is a jokegood review dc as normal  man are they all your beers does it have a beer alertgotta say i like the bike alarm feature what a good ideajust purchased a  plus thank god its still in the box cuz its going back to the store and im waiting for this  to come outive been waiting for this device for ages my edge  is already getting super old and after some four years with that device the rubber on the outside of the device is being nearly destroyed yesterday i saw gp lamas video about wahoo elemnt bolt update and nearly bought that thing thanfully i waited one more daywahoo have a challenge ahead i was looking at upgrading my mini dude  this is the edge ive been waiting for  ive been waiting and looking for a bike computer that i could use seamlessly between road and mtb i loooooove the mountain bike features that you highlighted    thanks for the review sweet job as alwaysjust sold my  month old  and waiting for this one to become available thanks for your reviewsthis was very helpful  i need a device primarily for navigation  i purchased the  over the wahoo roamthe climb locate alarm and heartrate range notification features were a big plusthis channel is very underratedgreat review dci am using a edge  plus and its fantastic however after seeing your review want to upgrade for a edge  i love the simplicity of non touch screen great review thx a lot cant wait to get my hands on iti just got a  edge so i am setting mine up thanks for making this videothanks ray may need to pick this one up cant wait to see what my grit and flow looks like overlaid on a map trailforks in there is huge too well done as always my friend im all in great reviewthe maps and climb features are excellent superb for something like a gf if you dont know the routewould you recommend this over the wahoo roam from either a mapping orbattery standpoint   also pulling routes from ridewithgps is there any difference thanks for the great review what i cant quite figure out anywhere is if its possible to navigate to a random point on the map so in other words can you pick a random spot on the map and navigate there or when on a pre loaded route decide to go somewhere elsemany thanks in advancegreat review buddy right on the spot keep onyour lunch behind  looks nice  great vidjust bought one and liked and subscribed  thanks for the great videocurious what you think of visibility in the sun glossyshiny screen cover vs the wahoo roam   looking for whatever is the easiest to see in mapping modei just got the small garmin edge  and damn am i impressedafter reading you deep review of this device great job by the way i decided to subscribe to your channelkeep it up it was a very fresh source of information for a purchase optiongreat review decision made now i know which model i want between the  and  cheersthank you for your reviewexcellent review really insightful  do you know if flow grit and jumps are coming to a garmin watch anytime soonafter posting this video youll need to hide a  on top of the beer boxes w the alarm activated  because your friends will surely be coming by to steal a few beers thank you for the review really clear and informativesome nice features there i always have concerns with garmin about software reliability and user interface awkwardness but otherwise this looks like a very competitive devicegreat reviewanyone know if garmin is going to release an update for this any time soon should i wait or pull the trigger in superb ordered thanks mannice collection of beer you have there  and you just made me really want this unit and ditch my wahoo elemnt boltafter this review i decided to finally update from my ancient edge    it was an incredible device over the last  years but it was time for an update and this has been great so farthanks  very useful and informativewithout the power meter do we still have the performance stats such as training load training effect vomax and lactate thresholdi think a lot of people wont realize how ground breaking this  is for mountain bikers thankfully your written review does and its spot on my favorite part was up till now the most attention that garmin has placed on mountain biking has simply been to add a generic mountain bike profile and offer you the ability to purchase a colored rubber condom for your edge device presumably to try and protect it when you smashed your bike into a rock face featurewise though theres been nothinggreat review im looking at upgrading from a   really helpful thanksfor bike riding i find that i cant get a touch screen like on the  to work properly cos my hands get too sweaty so buttons like on the  is much bettergreat review  does the garmin display zone power highlights while ridingcan you compare the  to wahoo elementvery informativei got a refurbished by garmin unit for   cant beat thatgreat review i got a question with my garmin edge  i have both  and  and use hrmtri when i am cycling but training performance on  doesnt work i can see all my date heart rate hr zones however i got no feedback like performance recovery time it does show my training info from my  but they just cannot combine togetherso i definitely had to hit the like button for another great video as well as what appears to be a great new device i like the format of bing bing bing what you need to know and then leave the details for the written review and even the hand off to des for the mb detail this looks like an eventual replacement for my  do you know if it will work with the remotealarms my see sense icon plus front and rear bike lights  lumens have alerts via bluetooth to ios app been using this function along w my ziplok zlok zip ties for as you say coffee shops etchi dc and thanks for your great review from it i gather trailforks data are already in the unit and you dont need to download them but what about trail updates if a trail gets added to trailforks is there a way to update trailforks data and download ithow did you get the standard mount on the canyon stem i snapped my o ring and got discouragedthanks a lot for the video great one can i have your advice i already have a forerunner  should i get the edge  do you recommend to get it i use my watch to do some other type of sports such as swimming so is it worth to buy it or with the fr is enough for a amateur bikerdo you know what version of bluetooth this  and the new  has do you know if its  i ask primarily because of the increased battery performance and extended rangegreat review now in  im torn between this and the wahoo bolt v is this still worth it thoughtsrecently got the bolt used a  and an  and im convinced the bolt is better for my purposes i wont be changing anytime soon but hopefully this will spur a response from wahoobig power numbers ray after  years still seems to be the best deal i am buying one today to replace the  years old  which still works fine but cant cope with navigation on a centenarywow nice review dcr wish my review videos were this goodlooks awesome  i just bought a  plus that i am happy with   is this one using usbc i did the mallorca     how did you like the climbs there  this is a tough ride really helpful review as a fellow roadbiker in the netherlands im torn between this and the wahoo bolt v what do you personally use herethanks just subscribed to your channeli wrap my s wrist strap over the handlebars to keep it on the bike if disaster strikes you know what would be great a review of screen protectors and aftermarket cases for fitness computers if you havent done one already thanks for the vidsupdate  fixed many minor issues climb pro now has  selectable hill ranges select all you see any hill fitting garmins definition of a climbhillmedium to largeonly largeothers complained about turn by turn direction  mainly the turn indicator arrow on the upper left corner of screen freezing at say  mile  ive never had that issue but can confirm the distance before a indicated turn shows to  ftis it still so cumbersome to create the training pages or was something changedhow many connect iq fields can be used edge   piecespoi on how did you stretch the garmin standard mount rings far enough to reach around your canyon stem i snapped one and gave up and put it on my handlebarsgreat video quick one whats the best way to get courses onto saved courses so climbpro can be availed ofhi dc rainmaker does the  have the round trio courseseverybody should have one of theseso would this be good for my world tour by bike next year or is the plus betterk thats it  the  over the bolt noice review my friendif someone places great importance on the baked in trail forks on the  does the new wahoo bolt match beat or lose to the edge  owner here purchased edge  as an upgrade my input here  it is a pain to set up using buttons had hand cramps multiple times trying arrange all screens i had in my   there is lost satellite warning beep which you cant turn off on  and pops up many times when you do anything on the unit when away from the windows and possible satellite signal reception contrary on  unit you have warning with option continue searching or not so you can  turn it off  on edge  you can customized road profile screen changing distance and elevation parameters what is not possible on edge  as you cannot get highlight over the numbers like on  and change values this might be a deal breaker for me to either go to  or quit and stay with my  of course processor is very fast and it boots almost immediately but once my  is on i have comparable reaction time using functions also much better screen resolution on wanted to add a new problem which occurred last weekend went to a big ride kmmiles and over m elevation gain and upon completion garmin  calculated my new ftp to be  and displayed my new best min to be  with over wkg total joke as i am in the range of  ftp i guess new unit is not bugs freeupdate on august  i have returned  and got  after km with  unit i can confirm that  is on top of my choices for garmin cycling computers followed by  then  sorry but  is not even close to touch screen units  screen menus are terrible and not even close to  screens conclusion   and  despite looking alike are totally different units and around  more is money well spend getting into great review thanks i just bought the edge  its my first cycling computer i do both road and mtb cycling however i took it out today to try and the distance was well off i did about km  on a uk cycle route but it said i only did km so you can imagine i was very disappointed from what i can see the gps was set to gpsglonass and i have read that just using gps  might help any ideas pleaseneed your help please dc  seams what with new mapping added my fenix  and also my edge ive lost car routing it acts as direct routing  have i read of a problem here   its much needed as had enough road riding off road unpaved as ocm maps list as paved   i need car routing again like yesterday  thanks replyis the find my edge feature also available through the web portal or only through the mobile appgreat sharingso glad i didnt get the bolt last week  i would have been pissedwanted a garmin device for the navigation but i was concerned about the new upgraded model being announced i didnt know if it will be this year but i was cautious and then iread the announcement on your site i used the chance to get the  discount in europe at the advertised shop  couldnt find cheaper price anywhere unluckily they didnt provide me the new customer  discount as it is available in the us but at least i didnt purchase the yesterdays versionthe new one was shipped today and the due date is th of june  i placed the order on th of mayhow trailforks mapstrails updating looks like is it easy automated process maybe  any test including trailforks functionality whats the point of bakingin trails into device  trails change every day emerge new ones old are closed permanently or temporarily  can i update tf trails on weekly basis  do i really need  trails from around the world when  of them ill never ride so can you download strava routes to the edge  w no issues like wahoo seems like everything else is better on garmin so was curious about the strava route or route sharing capability thank you great channel living the dream in amsterdam dcdo the grit and flow measurements only appear if im following a routedc you are kingwhere do i buy these bartapes of yours theyre greatgreat video  any idea if some of these new features will make their way to other garmin devices  i have a  and think some of the features would be cool to haveis there any chance the climbpro feature will trickle up to the  that would be awesomedc rainmaker ray second time i need some support for this edge question is there a reason why i find strava segments unselected in garmin connects segments menu when this happens i find garmin segments selected so i change the setting to stravabut it does not last i have  devices forerunnner   edge  this happens wth android app and web appwhen can i buy this in the netherlandscan kamoot make up the difference between  and  routing differences  on the fly finding somewherewhen will this thing be for salehow can i add the ride checklist to the garmin screen always forgetting somethingray where did you get that tshirt  i want onehello i have a problem in workout mode on the top of the screen i cant see the next step power and time only the current step noteyou know whyhow does this compare to the  ive seen a few deals that price the  around hi do you know if it is possible to add custom cues to a route planned in garmin connect ive tried to add cues to new routes but i cant seem to find a wayis speed displayed even if a cadence sensor is not fitted on the bikegood evening i wanted to know if you have any heart rate clock compatible with garmim  plus or is it just the same heart strapdc rainmaker i know this is an old video but i am looking for my first cycling computer and i went straight to the garmin  which i can get for  on sale in the uk but then i found the garmin  not the plus on sale for only  and i am now stuck which to pick i want to explore more with maps than chase koms so navigation and rerouting i am new to this area is more important to me any help would be amazing based on what is out there for sub  loved the videos btw how does it do off grid trails that we make ourselves im an enduro mx rider so its all bush ridinghi do the new garmin edge  support strava live segments toodc i need help is there a best settings for doing ftp wo using the edge method on the head unit  finally when i plug into my computer it only charges the unit but does not download any info to the garmin website in fact my computer does not see it at all to even select it on the browsehow can you do  route backworths  with  there is  easy slectionjust got my  and pretty impressed  new trail areas are a breeze no more riding lame courses  question about external display though  can you get you fenix x to just show your hr from the edge  i like the color zone coding on the watchs hr display but want to be using all the functions of the edge  garmin describes how to do this in reverse for say a triathlete  im think like this weeks race is km at m in extremely hot conditions  i want my watch just to show hr and zone color so i dont blow uphmmm ill see how long my  lasts before i upgrade was thing about the element bolt now i want to see what wahoo responds with garmins upgradeswhen are these going to be availablethanks for the video re navigation on a ride if i want to go a different route say take a shortcut to the one ive set and deliberately miss out a waypoint will the rerouting always try to force me back to that waypoint or does it realise ive passed that part of the course and continue on to the next waypoint hope that makes sensethanksthank youwhich one is better edge explorer or edge just ordered one over the bolt and roam which is more expensive im looking forward to mapping features on board and need to see if i can load programs from zwift therethanx can i import google maps locations from my phone to the edge  so i can navigate to that point if so howhi  just received my  map update needed doesnt work tho system asks for gb space  has only gb in total any tips   tanks in advancejust a new to bike computer does the mapping rely on your phones data or it has its own connection that does the route for some reason i dont bring my phone during trail would it still be working even if i dont have my phone with me find a route for a specific workout sounds interesting and helpful but does it really work any thoughts on thatthx for this review does it come with heart sensor wstrap  cadence sensor thanks in advance had to return my first  the return to previous screen button would not work  my second  works fine w seems there is power data spike garmin is still buggy on power data collection hi thanks for the report a query can i use it with wahoo kickr smart trainer my elements gps has stop working  i tried to recover it in many different ways but it looks like it is no repairable and i am thinking of buying a new bike computer could you please let me know if that garmin has same feature to work indoor and creates workout with the kickr one  thanks a lothey i always like your reviews thank you first off i tried the wahoo elemnt bolt v on one ride and despised it it had all the features i wanted like usbc etc but returned it i felt similarly to your review of it thus i wanted to switch to the edge  but dont want to pay  for something from garmin that is going on  years old including the fact it still had micro usb which was ancient even three years ago thus i am waiting for the update to this model guessing it will be  will you be doing a review of it when it comes out any insight or guesses when it would come out would love to know right when its released so hopefully i will be pinged when you post a review on it hopefully garmin connects with the st century and includes usbcwhen garmin gonna present  version hi man is there some cooperation with a watch for example with garmin fenix i mean calculating the training load if you do any other sports runningreal nice video would you recommend the  over over the  since the new  came out you can finde the  for so finally i can use a garmin head unit with my polar power meter pedalsmy  still works perfect battery life still more than  hours dont have any reason to change it so farthanks for the good review im looking for a device good for long rides  hours and more im planning some ultracycling races reliable resistant with the possibility of installing and reading gpx files and able to be recharged during the ride i was thinking about the plus but now with the new  i have another option do you think  could be good for me sorry for my bad english im italianhi dc ive a budget of  euros and i am thinking of a new garmin edge  i currently have the    and would like something with a larger screen in your opinion what would you recommend  thanks in advanceis there an optional key locking mount too so even if they try to take your bike they cant take the head unit as a consolation prizeso i dont mtb per say but i do gravel ride more and more and many of our gravel rides wind up on mtb trails  so i assume the trailforks features would be good on those trailsbut what about the gravel roads linking them  great review as always and i now need to buy  of these and sell my  and my partners   lolwere a gravity racing team looking to record data for our races ol man river racing  our upcoming race is only  sec or less wondering if the garmin products have adjustable activity timerstop watch readout that will show sec  manuals all look like hrs min sec     not fine enough im afraidnot sure if i will upgrade from my edge  but this  seems like a better deal than edge  and i really prefer real buttonsstill sitting on the fence with the  comments on the buttons sticking some seem to not have that problemive had my  for about a week now works flawlessly except for text message replies i pair with an iphone  and ill get messages but the reply feature is grayed out not allow to reply with any canned messages  any advice to get reply feature to function would be much appreciatedquestion i currently live in south korea with a large biking community i am about to ride the east coast next month are korea maps available i looked on the garmin site  for asia it only had the himalayas  russia is there a way get actual korea maps thanks for the review  your timegreat review thank youquestion what are those circular things underneath the barelectrical tape at  competition always makes tech better keep it coming etienne beney my husband found a cradle and hardwired the garmin to my dash unfortunately it bricked two days ago so im back to using my i yr old tomtomhow does this size up against the bolt a few reviews of the garmin  plus against the wahoo bolt had the them about the same with one or two having given the bolt a slight edge does this give the garmin  series the go ahead win kinda sounds like it one of the biggest things was battery life mmmmim in the market for my first gps computer ill wait till wahoo updates their boltelemnt line  yrs old now with no price decrease before deciding between a garmin or wahoolove the video  im looking to buy my first bike is there a bike that is good for dirt as well as pavement that you can recommend that isnt real expensive hi raycan edge  pair with ancient polar h heart rate strapdo you have a special mount at  that locks in a garmin  lost my last garmin it jumped out and im looking for something like a lanyardlockhelp garmin  or wahoo elemnt bolt vhi is it possible to create routes from the app on the cellphone and send it to the device  on the go with the  i see that you can now create routes on the go thanks to its touch screen it is the only relevant difference for me right now between the  vs the on youtubein the lower right hand corner click on settings click on speed set at great video  i am looking to buy an edge  but i have a question and i wonder if you might know the answer i had to return a wahoo elemnt bolt due to wifi issues  wahoo only support  ghz  my network band is ghz  it means wahoo cant find my router and therefore i cannot transfer files or update software unless i use a different router such coffee shops friends etc  does garmin have a similar problem you might knowthankshey dc is this climbs gonna come to the great review as always i need your help im new into cycling and in a market for a bike computer which one would you recommend either    and why really appreciate if you reply thanks a lothey ray  how does the process of loading a second map on the  work same as  plus ive got the na base map version on the way and need to add some custom euro maps on therehope you can compare this with wahoo elemnt roamso the find my garmin functionality is going to actually be a pita as my  connects and disconnects from the phone constantlyhi ray how many memory have the should i get the edge  or can the edge  read power data from my wahoo kickr while the kickr is paired to a pc running zwift   and how the hell did riding a bike get this complicated garmin  or wahoo roam im coming from a garmin  which has been buggy at times not as good at navigation as i hoped and after  yrs use now only has a  hour battery life my  before that was less than perfect too  the  seems to have cool features but wahoo has a reputation for being less buggymaybe i didnt catch this  are data fields selectable on a iphone app  or must fields be selectedcustomized on the unit itself i thought the review i read of yours on the  plus said that it will reroute you to get back on course toobut in this video you say you are listing the new features and mentioned it being able to reroute you back on courseso does the  plus also do ityou do an interesting thing where you look to your right briefly that small break in eye contact makes me feel like ive lost your attention and youre distracted nice viddoes it still automatically turn on the unit when you plug it in or unplug it  thats one of the biggest gripes with my  because it turns my cycliq ce camera back on and starts recording so i have to shut them both back off againis it possible to have the gps screen and your speed on the screen at the same timeis it still worth it getting this device this time aroundliterally have the  plus being delivered today is this worth the extra great review looks like a pretty solid device now depends on the price of course and how many of those features ill use one major annoyance of the  is that it fails to upload rides half of the time and have to turn the unit onoff againthe mountain bike navigation on my edge  plus is very disappointing unit is too slow to keep up on twisty trails with many trail intersections should i expect the  to be markedly betterwatched this after the gcn gmbn challengedoes it have ghost racing i ride the same route to work everyday and want to beat my best timewhat do you think i should buy  plus or good review as always with every review this device does a lot of stuff i dont really think i would use features like the drink metrics really what idiot needs to know that sort of stuff i am here to try and determine what garmin unit i will be go for next i bought the edge explore and since installing duraace di on my bike i found it doesnt play well with di cant garmin do an update to get it to do that simple little thing is that to much more to ask from that unit i guess i will have to spend hundreds dollars more just so i can do that and still have the same features which i like in the explore unit most of the upper more expensive garmins have more training features than i would find usable since i dont need to train at my ageand was thinking to move to wahoo next when i replace my edge  this might change my mindis it possible to configure datafields with garmin app this would be very usefulbetween  and  what are the notable differences  from garmin website mostly just touchscreen and popular routes for  but nothing else so is it worth buying  then is it still better than wahoo bolt vwhy the hell is wahoo not able to have the climbpro featureif it works i am sure the  edge is fantastic  if i upgraded from the  to  i had no problems with the  and expected much except none of my sensors will pair with the  i am relying on gps to tell me my speed i have since changed my phone reinstalled garmin connect but still it wont pair not happythanks for helping me very good video i have now to yers top model mio and i hate this gps slow and when i go racing and reining its completely useless rein drops changing menu pis of shiti think to bay   for me its mtb so its sold be perfect is good but indeed slow and battery life not good enough for long full day rides  if you know it is slow you can load your map in advance so that you dont need to wait and you are ready to go  my issue are the batteriesi was about to say dude you can pull w  i just got the unit i like it very much but the up and down buttons are very bad if you push them gently it doesnt register the push you have to press hard they could have made them like the select buttonthe lost location thing should be able to work the other way around if i drop my phone the unit should log that location as well maybe this is already a feature it should beedge  or wahoo boltfor sure i ve missed something i have activated climbpro feature in my profile i sue strava segment but this morning during a free ride when i was climbiing one of my strava starred climb i have not seen anything in my edge do i have to ride a saved route  i supposed that it would have actived climbpro screen everytime i m in one of my starred climb they match garmin formula just checkedrecommendeddoes it come with physio trueupcan you stream realtime heart rateamstelveenseweg  dutch for maple st someone posted on the zwift rider facebook page asking if they should upgrade to the  before i watched this my answer nonanswer was did the new features justify the price i am very happy with my  because the extra features of the  wasnt worth it in my mind and clever training is selling the  for u now anyone interested in a used has anyone figured out how to get rid of the virtual partner large green field on the bottom it takes up so much space you say it has a  hour battery lifeis that you actually tested or just what garmin saysgarmin said the  had a  hour batterylife but that never lasted longer then  hoursno  bluetooth connectivity problems meaning once you finish your ride you must upload it manuallysuch incredible bloatwarehas your ftp gone down some  watts ray will the edge  be os updated to do the samethis or wahoo elemnt bolt what watch is thatwhats a rowtedge  or edge explorerthis lost features doesnt work i tried it and cant find my edge   last location kept showing home location   thanks for the reviewwahoo elemnt or hey bro thanks for the video just wondering how accurate is the battery life for the  in real world use close to the hours or nadamn would it kill garmin to include a simple dpad its annoying enough on the watches ton navigate maps but inexcusable on sich a big deviceis this gps still worth it in your work is this channelgarmin had a great sized device out called the  then they bought out the  which was smaller  i thought why just why then they revamped the  to this is getting back to normal size but i just dont think garmin are getting it properlystill lacks configuring the head unit from the app as someone who runs a number of screens for various activities this seems like a nobrained but i suppose garmin thinks its a onetime setup so the investment in the app isnt worth itim sure garmin could add a load of these features to the edge  or  units with software updates but of course they wont because they want your money if i already own a garmin fenix x apart from larger screen why do i need a bike computer when i can use the garmin fenix xonly if they have ui settings via phoneeasier httpsyoutubecbexruktkt what mount is that is it some understemring mount link pleasethe  is so so so so so slow glad to hear it is faster i havent finished the video yet but i hope the battery life is bettersorry ray but nobody rides  miles without looking at their garmin and i bought a bryton rider   months ago the ui seems a bit snappier but mapping still looks clunky afdoes anybody know what is going on with stages new dash models breaking news last summer and since then  total silence  screw garmin  when is the beer review up faster processor on a garmin edge what finally my edge  will be slower than the newest modelsthis may sound basic but why cant garmin make a phone app that does all what the edge dose i feel these bike computers should be redundant unless there is an app out there that does most of the edge does already if so please let me knowi noticed that you can buy rugged waterproof android phones for  are there any android apps that are actually as good as a garmin bike computer like thisany idea when availablethe screen resolution is horrible you can make all the changes you want backlight always in included but it does not get better i had  batteries were the real issue but buttons and screen betterfound this channel and appreciate the content as i am getting back into bike touring  i am planning a cross country rideusa and am considering the  or the  plus  its  price differencemy primary use is navigation and loading alot of routepoi content from gpx filesis the difference between the two products worth it you thinkthanks for the tip to the written review the yt is irritating to the point of being unwatchablefor those of us who are concerned about display size is it fair to say that the  often has a larger area utilized for contents than the  seeing that the  needs to show software buttons in many contexts while the  instead overlays the icons indicating the functions of its physical buttons on top of the contents eg panscrollzoom in maps modegarmin  or wahoo roamnever felt like a bigger idiot for buying a  plus last year hope someone other brand leapfrogs so i can switchanyone else get this for christmas gradient in amsterdam impossiblethis aimed more for odd roadkw garmin fanboys everywhereid be more impressed if garmin devoted as much time on sorting their woeful interfaces and software than they do on frankly gimmicky shite like grit and flowif i will buy garmin edge  in china  europe map will also includedbike alarm is misleading to leave the garmin mounted on the bike while going into a cafe somebody can grab the garmin instead of the bike so bloody slow cor blimey guvnori still dont get why anyone would buy a standalone bike computer at all  multi sport watches are way more useful in terms of what  of the planets sports people need its literally like buying a point and shoot camera when you have a great camera in your mobile phone moving maps equates to having a mechanical shutter  yup sounds great no one uses it touch screen display yup overkill an up and down button works just fine and more tactile too you cant go for a run with a standalone swim dive activity counting use as a normal worknotification wrist top device etc etc i just dont understand why people still buy these things was so close to buying a wahoo now this has come out hmmm rip my walletif they would only have made it touch screeni see no reason to upgrade kink of like just buying the newest iphone for no reason other than it is newfull map routing  lezyne already know how to do that years ago and they cost a fraction of edge  price  its like apple ios vs andriod os  garmin  apple ios lmaoim new in this things so let me understand  garmin edge  is the past model and garmin edge  is the next generationinb all the butthurt  buyersno usb type c is a fucking deal breakerhimy name is kiko and iamwritingfromigpsportcontactingyouforgpsbikereviewcurrentlywehaveanewproductyouwouldbeinterestedinthat the correct way to say that is how many bottles you should have drunk not should have drankplease slow the dialogue down for the love of godtake a breath slow downso the  plus was possibly the worst buy evermeh i like my edge  psame buttons material that will crack within  yrs its not a nightmare but really could be better too much bugsbought the  it is full of issues mainly does to connect to power meters the new software patch does not solve the problems this is a newly release as being the best thing out there well it does not work  so does not even make the cut of worth buying garmin should add another option to their surveys rather than would you recommend the  it should be would you not recommend the  stay away from it if you want a happy ridethndsorry you talk way too fast and it is aversive  it is a shame because you really do know your stuffstvery knowledgeable but i cant understand this nice fella  diction annunciation its really difficult to hear certain words and he hardly pauses in between sentences  lets chip in some money to get him a speech coachnote beware of buying a garmin  because it is a pile of junk it restarts itself automatically i contacted the garmin support team and they didnt find any solution for mei definately would not suggest to buy this one save some money and go to other brand requiring garmin connect and express is annoying synchronize courses needs to be done one by one sync with connect does not take the new courses created by the same garmin connect the usability to show when it is recording and not simply does not exist several times i rode kms to realize it was paused mainly when using the navigation mode please garmin add a single icon light feedback anythingif you will use just to get simple data maybe is an option but anything more than this will have the annoying connect and a terrible usabilityhi really like this device however if using it at the range surely the range balls will give wrong resultsgood review very interested learning more about how the launch monitor worksare the launch monitor statistics captured for later reviewdo you know if using limited flight range balls over normal balls would make a difference in the readings with the g if not would it be possible for a video on it thanksi practice with these soft rubber balls indoor would it workdont need a launch monitor  what happened to the g  is it discontinued  would it still be a good purchase if i find onethis thing is actually amazing i love minethanks for the honest review you raise some very interesting points on why and why not to buy the unitmay have missed it but can it be used on an indoor netcan you track your club distances and then have clubs recommendedis it true it over heats and shuts down when in practice modeugh so torn getting this or just shelling out another  for a skytrak that has so much more can it make my ball go straighter if not i dont need it for  poundsi love how the ball just disappears at is the unit waterproof in any way my only concern is getting caught in the rain one day i like the radar featuresbeing able to work out the distances of each of my clubs and monitor swing speeds makes this s very attractive product i would likely use it more for play than practice the approach s watch is the other product im considering i like the idea of the larger display on the g but from a play perspective is it a better choicefor that price what r u really expectinghey folks thanks for watching dont forget to check out the full indepth review for tons of details especially on accuracy of optical hr and gps as well as more nuances of various features like pulseox and fda certification httpswwwdcrainmakercomgarminfenixplussxindepthreviewhtmlaloha you do a awesome job explaining key points on every product you do a video i appreciate you this was a straight forward priceless review thnksamazing reviewcomprehensive review great thanks thanks ray geeky and useful  small detail im using my fenix s right now the old one and note that the speed with which the menus change in your video plus version is significantly faster than minegreat video  thanks just bought my fenix is there any other difference between  plus and x plus despite of the oxmeter battery life and sizeare the maps feature exactly the samethanks and regardshey nice video just one question is your fenix  is the sapphire edition is the map any smoother when rotating  my fenix  has a delay when following a trackgreat review  thanks do you know if there will or can be a firmware update for the x that will enable storage and playback of musichey there are a couple of things i seem to miss in every every review ive seen up to now also for the x how does entering coordinates work on the trail and start navigation to them what options do you have for the map is north up also possible now we bought a vivoactive  for my wife i do like a number of functions but i also want the mapping and use it for geocaching so i need the option to enter coordinates easily i also do prefer to have north up on gps although i could work with track up if neededhey ray i have a question im looking between the x plus or the suunto  for ultramarathonswhat has been your experience been in terms of gps accuracy for both of thesegreat detailed review as always this is a very curious update it added features i think some fenix  owners were hoping could be software patch updated and other features that i think people were puzzled why the fenix  didnt have the price increase is the real killer with china putting out bargain watches that match the fenix  plus features amazfit stratus and from what ive seen are not complete crap not mention mainstream competition  i would have thought garmin would be matching the outgoing fenix  prices or maybe bringing them down im curious to see how the market reactshi thanks for this review i have a question you mention that is the standard f edition non sapphire glass i presume but looking at garmins website i cant see that model at all the regular edition has a silver bezel the only one with a black one is the sapphire edition but then it also has some red accents unlike the one in the video could it be that they might release this regular edition colour later i would like a black one but wont pay the extra for an unnecessary on my case sapphire glass just for the colourgreat walk trough biggest difference between  plus und x plus is the pulseox and the size or  hard choice then there are the  and the x but the  has the best battery life from them all keep goinghi ray i dont need the music or mapping and currently have the original fenix  i really want all the new training metrics are these identical for the fenix  and plus if so would you recommend saving the extra money and just upgrading to the fenix  many thanks adamthe screen resolution looks so much neater and sharper than the fenix what headphones would you recommend with the fenix  plus hearing mixed results for different models when it comes to dropouts and suchmy fingertip based pulse ox can get a reading in  seconds from wake up hope they improve pulse ox in future firmware revisions as it seems a bit poor at the momentthanks for the details ray have you had a chance to test battery life on the plus series yet im curious how accurate the reported life is or if you can extend that by turning off features such as the pluse ox or monochroming the screen seems like weird product design to move away from the ultraendurance market but maybe that sells more watches overall and is worth the trade off any thoughtsjust curious to see on the fenix x plus if the pulse ox sensor on watch reads the same numbers as a medical grade sensor  this would make for an interesting comparisonon the music menu what does control phone option do  does it allow browse and selection of podcastaudiobookmusic that is on the phone  like you can in any modern car via bluetooththanks for the great review what bluetooth headphones are you usinghello very nice video i have questions i own a garmin fenix  and a garmin fenix  plus i tried both of them on a treadmill and the fenix  is extremely accurate about the pace  distance whilethe fenix  plus even after several calibration is not accurate at all any suggestion about this issue maybe something im not doing properly the second question is about the vo  does it change after a treadmill work out or it is affected only by an outdoor run thank you dgreat review  after this review i am sold on the switch from my suunto watch to the garmin fenix  plus  does garmin have an appwebsite to sync all of your activities too and share with others  thank youhi ray or anyone else that can answer this i mainly cycle but have decided to have a go at a couple of triathlons and obviouslt the fenixplus is a better fit for that purpose than my current edge  my question about the product is this if i connect my vector  pedals tot he fenix and skip the  totally will i still get the pedal metics leftright power center offset power zone etc etc as i get with the  am not too worried if they arent shown on the watch as long as they are still there and accessible in the connect app is it possible to load a course to the fenix  plus and have the course display during a ride but not have navigation vibrations on a mtb ride today it was vibrating on every switchbackpretty annoying when i really just want to look at the map occasionally to make sure im on the right trail thanksim yet to use my fenix  plus after adding the music and was wondering if the music starts when you start an activity on the watch could you advise please dcr thankshey can you charge the watch while tracking a tourrun without losing any datai am not sure if it is because of a new hardware or new software but to me it got a buttery smooth and faster ui dont you think soui is much fastersmoother than my fenix  i wonder if they upgraded the socwill an activity on an edge show up via garmin connect on the fenix training status for example if i hike and the ride my bike will the fenix know that i had more training stressfenix x plus  pulseox hallo if you are using stryd do you take speed and distance from stryd or from gpsin the video you mention the x only difference is the pulseox sensor i thought i read it had a larger battery as well can you confirm are these two differences along with size the only difference in the x also can you confirm if the processor  speed is the same as the x none plus thank you for your amazing contenthi are you doing a suunto  ui walktrough anytime soon how do you get your vo max on the watch   thanksi really love the fnix  but just worried if its the right one for me is the display highly visible outdoors and under gym lighting im partially blind and worry about the brightness the only sports i do are cycling swimming and lifting weights think this is a good matchprobably not a big issue at all with fenix  fans but using buttons to cycle through and dismissarchive social media notifications doesnt seem very easy the strength activity imho works better with a touch screen too a fenix  with buttons and a touch screen might be a good  option in the futurehi allwhats the difference between fenix s plus and fenix s is it worth to spend extra money for plusdo you happen to know what version of bluetooth its usinghmmm the possibility to test if youre having sleep apnea with the pulseoxi just bought this watch today i know it a  and there is a couple more upgrades but i have been a samsung galaxy watch user and they have nothing like this and also its like i just upgraded to a better watch the only thing im going to miss is the bezel but thanks for the reviewdo you think the garmin fenix  plus sapphire is worth  dollars more than fenix  sapphire i dont think ill use the maps much so its more if the watch is worth the  extra for music better gps etcgarmin slightly changed the design of the fenix x plus from the previous model this year is still nice but i prefer last years designhi how do you choose between this or the polar grit x at the same priceis the bluetooth signal on the fenix  plus strong while steaming music via the watch or is it flaky like the garmin forerunner just curious what headphones are they  im looking into getting something for running that would pair with my  musicta  no rushi cant tell from this did they remove the move notification where it buzzes if you havent walked enoughdidnt see pool swim profile is it thereis the calorie count fixed on this watch i ask because i had the  and had to return it was showing  to  times my burned calories looked in forums and many others have had the same issue but i loved the watch so is it fixed on this oneno sleep details in the watch still waiting for thati have the fenix  sapphire should i upgrade the only new thing is the nfc payment and the maps orcan i choose tenis sport optionsgood video thanksif you could answer calls couple questions its important for me to measure blood oxygen i know that this unit measure heart rate but could you verify that the oxymeter actually measures oxygen similar to one a person would use one there finger the other is it appears that you really like garmin so would you say its definitely worth the money  via the website the oxymeter only comes in the  mm thats a big watchhow do you set up the vo max and training loadi have only just got my watchbut is it true that the fenix  will come out sooninteresting video it seems to me to assume you are very familiar with these kinds of watches however the fenix  plus is my first watch of this caliber reading garmins manual is not very helpful in this video you are pushing the buttons very fast is there a video that explain what each button does  when to push it depending on what you are doing etc ie sometime during setup i got the language set to unknown language which i didnt know i looked and looked and read the manual to try to get english back tried doing a complete reset tono avail fortunately i did get it back but for the love of me i do not know how i did it what is the process to actually set something when you decide it is what you want how do you add the icons to the circular view or to delete themits runnig with bluetooth i have the  plus that i got a week ago and am wondering how i get vo max  training status settings configured im a cyclist and hiker not a runner and when i go to widgets and locate the vo max display it says to run  minutes with heart rate  times it also says no status for my training status and the same message about running  times ive got several hiking activities already logged and saved appreciate any help thanks if i go arof that you can see my paypal password  oh shitmy fenix x plus updated today to  and now there is no pulse oximeter widget was the pulse oximeter option taken away can you verify with your watchquick question did you get so healthy from running aloneare you on a beta firmware i cant seem to find the gps  galileo support on my watch i tried adding topoactive europe on my fenix x plus it failed said not enough storage and i had zero songs or anything else on there yet any advicecould you use an ipod touch and still get most of the functionalityis there anyway of disabling or pausing the stepsi was so disappointed with the fenix x because the screen was sooooo dark how does the plus compareif i got it right the s and  dont have map support but the s plus and the  plus dofor us newbies i have the following suggestionsone speak more slowlytwo it is not always clear which button youre pressing try to have only one finger over the buttons at one timedoes the fx plus have notifications icons like whatsappwhats the most accurate among the gpsgpsglonass or gpsgalileocant help myself but i find the silver line on the top of screen disrupting is the heart rate bluetooth or ant plusisnt it better to wait for is it me or there is no way to adjust the date i just made a mistake and entered the wrong month when turning on the watch for the first time and now i realize there is no way to set the right date how annoyingi will wait for further updates rumor has it that one of the next versions will measure the length of ones toenails and precise pubic hair curvature this together with gct gcb instant messaging and music for hours on end will provide a long awaited catalyst both in motivation and in performancehello master of cycling gadgets i have a tough question  i have notices that when i am recording an activity at zwift then there is no impact at garmin connect app regarding  training status or training effecti have written that you must record only from garmin device in order to get these data updated at the same time the data are not equal from garmin device and zwifttacx neo  most of the times the km are much less at garmin devices than zwifttacx neo recordings  my equipment is garmin   tacx neo zwiftat fenix   happens the samewhat the heck is happening  does the new polar syncs perfect with zwiftinteresting to see the fenix  plus looks a little beaten up already the black bezel is marked so its no more durable cosmetically than the previous generationanybody else go check their vo max to comparebeautiful watch great for outdoors but horrific for gym training and indoor use polar is way better for thatthis or x these watches need touch screen with  physical buttons as well it would be so easy and natural to use them now i see just pain and struggleim going to buy the  plus sapphire ever hear of factoryoutletstorecom legit or not  for black leather band modeldoes it support more than  gendersadele taylor swift  better be your wifes playlistits funny how the watches are bigger and bigger but the screen always same size and same low resolution i think garmin should consider it everytime they increase the new version price terribly inaccurate watch  pulse rate is always off  gps is mostly spot on but not reliable as the suunto  i returned my fenix went back to suuntoreally bad watch get scratched in  second not that interesting any other half price watch will do the same or better job  returned boom i have the rose gold version of this watch  absolutely love it after being fitbit for years love the way it just looks like a watch  great review by the way xxnice review thanksalthough i did kinda lol at or even hiking wouldnt that be covered by the walking modecan you use it as a stop watch or timerwill the clock work with an empty batterywhy did you not show the app and what stats you getcan one show the digital time at the same time as the analog  or does the hands move away thanks levi in swedencan this watch show dual time zone because i travel a lot can i show boston time vs bangkok timehi what material is a glass of this watch i think it is a plastic not mineral glass and what about message calls and whatsapp alerts how it workswhats the battery life likeis it normal for my cursor randomly move arounddoes it store musicis the heart rare on constant  the lights are never off always on yesi guess the hour hand should have been yellow and the minute hand some other still clearly readable color stupid basic mistake they madehow long the battery can livei dont think  days is a long enough to review any hr watch especially its sleepawake functions just mho\n","['garmin', 'marq', 'athlete', 'samsung', 'galaxy', 'watch', 'active', 'coros', 'vertix', 'gps', 'adventure', 'watch', 'suunto',

does it go against garmin fenix s what do you thinkgarmin fenix  in the coming future its the first time i hear it any insights on the time when on the market and price ranges  or fenix hr replaced my apple watch  for this beast i hope it delivers all the updates made the apple watch obsolete in can you answer calls on this watchthe garmin pay app doesnt work in the uk doesnt even take mastercardwhat do you think to garmins power screen technologythanks for the review its always good for me to see these reviews on the smaller sized watches since i have a thin wrist it helps me gauge how it may look on meone of the best videoclip reviews ive viewed  thanks for sharingbest review ive seen for this watch what a great video mate  what i was looking for cheersawesome review  helped me with my plus upgrade great review thanks i actually have th  pro solar but its so feature packed that one i got beyond the basics i visit videos like this just to build my knowledge on different features that i may use occasionally this video was really useful for thatexactly the information i was looking for brilliant review you got my  thanks mandude this is like an amazingly clear and super high quality video i love it im a huge garmin fan and im trying to get my hands on one of thesethanks for the fantastic review just ordered my upgrade from the fenix s great video top quality production perfect review  thank youawesome review to the point and you listed the pros and cons nicely thanks mategreat review  ill be ordering one soon actually this review was better than  of other smart watch reviews blabbing about pay with your smartwatch nonsense i need outdoor sports function so many important informations in this review thank yougreat reviewgood job man awesome reviewyou have me sold which bike is thatthanks very informative video regarding the bad side  to strapping the watch on the bike ie not getting heart rate theres a solution wear a chest strap hr monitor it can report to the watchawesome review  just got this watch helped me figure it out  thanksvery neat beard man i am proper lusting after this watch for features battery and overall durability i found the fenix  pro sapphire best it was actually the sapphire screen with its true blacks that sealed the deal as id originally ordered a s sapphire pro and returned it when it arrived with a blue screen instead of a full refund i said i wanted to pay the difference to get the  sapphire and i couldnt be happier i absolutely love this watch and im really pleased i made myself upgrade instead of refund i was so disappointed when that screen lit up blue instead of black id assumed all sapphire model watches had the true black screen but not the s sapphire huge dealbreakeri hope theyve fixed the issue now because i made it known when upgrading that other than the screen i would have been perfectly happy its a really smart looking watch in black thanks great reviewgreat review definitely thinking about replacing my iwatchthank you thank you very informarmativegreat review thanks  just wondering can this version have preloaded music or audible bookswhat a watch these things are really moving forward garmin is doing really good with invitationoh i see it does nice video gr review love this watch i have the fenix s and im tempted to upgrade for the solar capabilities one thing i noticed they used springbars now instead of screw in bars like in my s  not sure if thats an improved feature or notthe fenix  series is the king of activity trackers from the amazing build quality to its ability to track a wide range of activities  i love ithi the best review of this watch ive seen thanks alot  just a quickie which watch face is that looks great  thanks thanksoswm video brogreat review and definitely pushed me to  buy  even though  the solar does nothing for me but seems to have a few extra small extra features but in my opinion  it looks better i have gotten bored with black fitness trackers how would you rate this shale grey colour also do u think  it would mix well with other colour bands great review quick question do you get the blueish screen issue like the backlit got washed out quite a few reported but only in sapphire version i thinkhi great review what version as re you using in the review ie what colour watch and band thankslooks great and im considering buying the watch but curious about the swimming features did you test it for pool swimmingi have the polar v now so this would be a big upgradesei molto bravohey i really like your video i just have quick question i was just about to hit the buy button on the s pro solar when i accidentally saw that its  mm thick vs mm for the s pro is this due to the solar panel and doesnt that make the watch even bulkier than the s proi am going to get me one for this yeargreat review is there a difference between the s solar  s sapphire other than the solar same mm etcthinking about upgrading my forerunner  about  years old at this point  to this one i might have to relearn all the fancy new updates since my current one doesnt have half these featureshi nice channel ive just subscribe im wondering here which make more sense in overall this one or a  solarthank you for the good review question if the battery is completely drained can i use the solar power only to charge the watch without the power cable and how long its going to take to get enough power and use the watch again lets say for day or two thank youthanks for the great review do you find the s to be as comfortable during activitysleep as the forerunner  im debating between the s sapphire and the forerunnersi have vivoactive  and cant decide on upgradehey guys does the s pro solar have surfing on the sports list great video if it has surfing im soldit a very good watchsorry great review but i couldnt help raising an eyebrow when you said it transfers  of the suns energy into the battery dnot sure if you are aware garmin offers bike handle bar mounts for some of their watches not sure which models thoughgreat watch and almost perfect just dont understand why they would waste space with a compass on the bezel that could have easily been etched into a much wider photovoltaic bezel insteadhello mate thanks for a good review may i ask a few follow up questions  im thinking of getting a garmin x pro for hiking but i was wondering if it can be recharged by a power bank and does it take long to recharge  do it require a lot of power to refillgreat review i have owned the s for just over a year would you recommend an upgrade to the sim looking to replace wearing both an apple watch and a whoop and think this might be the one are you familiar with the whoop and would you say this is comparable and would work well by replacing both wearablesis a really good watch battery rated for  days but i used it for almost  days w out recharging but it got some cons like i wish it focus on counting steps cause when i dont bike thats what i focus on samsung does this count steps perfectlyi am switching from the apple watch  to either the instinct solar or the fenix s pro solar which one do you recommend me and if i chose the fenix is the solar edition really worth itcan i also ask as clearly you like your mtb what is the best widget to use for following routes and finding good trails  is it possible to bluetooth to some headphones directions or get the garmin to talk instead wouldnt need to look at the watch then  ive been using trailforks with a garmin edge but just bought this solar watch will sell the computer now  in the end my iphone with komoot was best for navigation but rubbish at finding trails there doesnt seem a perfect solution to find techy trailswhen do u think is the fenix  coming out bruvto your comment about attaching the watch to your bikes handlebars but having to do without heart rate monitoring you could wear a chest strap and monitor you hr that way correct or were you saying that if the user is in the turn by turn map mode that they just wouldnt be able to see their hr thanks in advancehi im considering getting either the fenix  or s but not sure which one would look better on my wrist i have relatively slim wrists at cm i noticed the s looks kind of small on your wrist so was wondering what size wrists you have thanksyou said about expeditions what at day walkers  does it count steps  does it come with maps does it have golf courses on itdoes it have timer  countdown timer i couldnt find itmay i ask what is your wrist circumference i am trying to decide if  s or  is better for me with cm wristhave owned this almost a year and love it except for a couple of huge frustrations i got the titanium one and that was a huge mistake because it scratches really easily  i wear it full time and very active this is not the model to get for active people im starting to feel embarrassed when i go out because at this point the watch looks like trash  still works great but scratched bracelet and bezel   when i ride my bike i have several connected devices i have a power meter  my headset for music my phone  and hr monitor and garmin radar  varia   ever since i added the varia i can no longer listen to music and have the radar connected at the same time   this is annoying as hell considering i paid k for this gadget this is clearly a known issue form garmin since this is a well documented issue that lots of folks are reporting unfortunately there is no fix to be found overall i love this device and the garmin ecosystem but for k i expected a more rugged watchhello im raka from indonesia is still worth to buy this sport watch in  i hope your answer to help me thankyouwhat could be different btn suntos gps vs garmin x gps and sunto gives more battery time with gpsis this the very latest fenix when was it releasedgreat watch for my wifes wristdoes it have a storm alert functionhow is the bluetooth connection when you use bluetooth headseti have a question does it comes with an inbuilt mic so that we can receive incoming calls also can we reply to the notifications hereive just bought a instinct from wiggle garmin are offline bit of bad timing will this link up to polar cadence and speed sensors on my racing bikei just looked at the price and got a fright  ill look at the othershaving a hard time to choose between the s solar and s pro solar what do u think i will wait for the fenix  which will probably has a touchscreen and ecgi have the x pro saphire one in my opinion a sports watch needs saphire glass is there any way you go on an expedition or hiking adventure where the activity takes longer than  days to turn off the watch completely and just wear the watch and charge it maybe attach the watch to your pack and let the sun charge it to full status if so im sold on this item otherwise how can i use it when im lost and the watch died at least there could be a way to charge and revive thisis it touch screen or do you have to use the buttons on the side to select everythingdoes the s pro solar comes in black most of what i saw sold on rei best buy and amazon in the us are grayish the face also says women of adventure im assuming this can be changedis the solar charging really effectivehow is your light on your solar mine looks like it doesnt worki just received my fenix  pro solar whats the big difference between the s pro solarwhat colourway is thisyep and yepis this the smallest version mmthe app  watch face slot limit must be removed it isnt perfect by any means but is among the best in class considerably better and much pricier than its predecessors   for those wondering a screen protector does not appear to affect the solar charge  garmin express will indicate that updates are due and may take a hundred syncs updates disconnects and reconnects to change the status to uptodate very clunky  ski maps and i believe golf courses can be deactivated if unneeded but thats not good enough for me i wish they could be removed altogether to empty storage  its also rather unclear what the differences between the preinstalled maps and garmins city navigator and cycle maps are and whether city navigator  cycle maps can be installed on the device i havent tried as i have not the maps in questionthinking about to choose this one but got the feeling that the colour is a bit purple or is it more grey theres no chance to see  it in real here so someone might help would be greatare u still using s or s small size i got inch wrist still decidinghow does it compare to fenix  pro solar just sizeis the hart rate as good as using chest strap monitori bought this watch recently after first charge with a usb cable on the screen i got notification  d  nine days battery life   next day i placed it under the sun to charge it from sun energy but nothing had changed  still  days of battery life remained  what benefits the sollar charging has if battery life is not changing which watch is preferally for health alertshi  recently we lost famous person during his workouts with heartatack is this watch help people to avoid or give alerts  in what type of watches will give this type of alerts so that it will help every oneare garmin better than casio thanksnearly  minutes you never actually tested whether the solar actually charges the watch or not if one pays a premium for solar charging i would like to know if it solar charges how fast in what conditions or is it so minimal you could tell it actually charges at alldoes a screen protector mess with the solar ive got quite small wrists so is there a risk of this looking to bigdoes no one find it strange that none of garmins high end rugged watches have a touchscreendoes it trake your sleepsorry if i missed it does it have a touch screendoes it have temperature sensor what would you choose fenix s sapphire or s pro solaris garmin smart watches g lte like iwatch and write mails and make phone calls without having my phone on mehow long to charge  to  from solar so no fenix do garmin watches have touchscreenis this line of their brand watches salt water proofgarmin fenix is not actually a watch its a tool that looks like a watchi love this but it expensive for me did love a camera built in  not a selfie camera i mean a real proper camerahehe bad timing garmin being hacked on the day this video was released where is it made in chinai have my eye on a s pro solar with slate grey strap for  bit worried that the s strap wont fit my wrist as it looks like it is aimed at women anyone have issuestedious reviewerim still waiting for the most important feature that gives me a  minute warningwhen im going to have a heart attackand direct me to the nearest defibrillator man the person that comes up with thatis going to be seriously rich i accidentally buy that since fenix  and x is to big for meby god i have this and i have to say it was so beautiful if you look it for yourself rather than in video the gold is for the girl but the gray one definitely for a male dont reply to me and say im being a mean person im just curious i dont know if it is just me but is your left eye looking right and your right eye is facing the camerasolar is a gimmick youre better off investing in the saphire versionat least youll have some use for itso you pay  and dont even get the dlc coating on the bezel or sapphire glass which you get on the cheaper model no thanks and the battery life on the s is already good enough for  of people unless youre planning an expedition to everest and really need that extra  per hour in which case you would probably have a usb power bank with you anyway i have the s sapphire and did a  mile bike ride once and still had  battery left  photovoltaic doesnt mean that it will convert  sun energy into power there are no panels that has  efficiency most of the sun energy is reflected only small amount is turned into electric power  photovoltaic means nothing more than  photovoltaic real photovoltaic efficiency is around  any other number is only marketing pwill this work on a tattooover  quid wtfi checked for this watch but says for women expensive watch for a short life span screen display really sucksis this color too feminine looking  can a guy pull it offjust be aware that is just bs and gimmicky   just buy a normal fenix and save money   those endorsers are paid to talk and overhype those watches   just do your own research about and visit the garmin fenix   forum to see for yourself about how faulty and unreliable data those watches provide  there great until they break garmin has the worst customer service buy a different product and spare yourself some griefhey james great video i am considering picking this up but have  questions does this model have the same bluish tint backlighting display issue as the other s and s sapphire have does the amethyst steel look very purple in person wish they had solar in black  worried this will be too purple but hard to tellthanks in advancethats my boy i love all tech and product reviews great job dude looking forward to future nerd videos as you expand your everyday carryjust purchased one of these second hand after this review cheers matehey vince i havent invested in a smart watchgps watch yet nice reviewalso nice gains bro  you have bulked up since running  miles keep inspiring usthats what im talking about right there great review vince a solid watch especially for the price the newer watches have way too many metrics that many people dont understand or even need i know many runners that are happy with that watchthanks for the detailed review i was little bit confused between forerunner   vivoactive  nw am clear  will go with forerunner an accurate gps is the main thing i love the heart rate data though haha good video my mannice review i am new to the running watch hunt this video helped me make a decisionbro the review was great  you are doing really go getting out of the norm this is good man going to go into more growth lets goooooothank you ive been debating whether to forgot my iwatch for this garmingreat review on this watch accurate gps is key i dont do a lot of running but i really want to pick up a fitness watch for the gym the gyms in new york are finally opening tomorrow great video and review brogreat review vince thank you great reveiwthanks for your great review i just bought it two days ago and i have gone on a run yesterday and on a bike ride today and it works very well i had an older forerunner  for doing both sports and a separate smart watch and wanted to get something better without spending much i would have loved to hear how much you paid for it i paid  usd for it and i am finding it an excellent value for money it is my only watch now i downloaded a custom screen and it is just perfect for me  i have the chest strap already so i normally use it for both sports i am glad to hear that the heart rate sensors with the watch are not very accurate the sleep tracker seems to work well too i have the smart notifications on and it works quite well what i dont find is an easy way of deleting them all at once without having to go clearing one by one  if someone knows please let me knowlove the reviewsexcellent review sirthe watch is top for the price durable also i wear mine daily now for two years use it running cycling walking working still works perfectgreat review i love my garmin  does the job perfectly had for yrsthanks for infois there any difference between this and the  besides more screen spacethanks vince    perfect watch for me  to buygreat review great watchi own a xt garmin is super accurate when it comes to gps i have a chest strap although not practical its accuratereally like the walkthrough you had done of the watchclear thoughts clear explanations keep up man i am about to get it for the gps a d strava compatibility too my current mi watch does not sometimes gets to stravaso whats a good alternative for around the same price just looking for something with a better heart rate monitor i guessi got that watch to its realy amazing for runningi didnt know you do reviews great content alwaysstill rockin my  its survived countless spartan ocr and trail runs mud rain lakes good watchi am loving my garmin so far it does feel cheaply made and i was hoping it was touch screen but now that i have adjusted i love it  only down fall i really had was that garmin stopped working a day after i bought itit would help if you state in the descrip or title  when was this watch introduced releasedthe sasuke picture in the back but this was a solid review vince  i wore a fitbit for a long time but didnt love it and i always heard pretty good things about garmin products facebook marketplace is definitely a goto to get things on sale too because nobody can complain about saving some money  i realized i forgot to post on yesterdays video but we still want to see your blonde phase at some point and see those blonde  eyebrow piercing pictures cc dandibambithis same model i have been using it for almost  years now and i have done over  miles with it and it still strong of course the hr goes up and down so i use a chest strap other than that this watch had been a badass still looks new and works goodgood review vince looks like a awesome watch my last watch was a garmin vivoactive found it really good to use the heart rate seem to work better when done up pretty tight ya wrist after  years the battery didnt hold a charge really liked the garmin it even had pay wave was handy could pay for stuff from the watch i did a bit of research found that the coros apex mm has amazing battery life like a month before ya have to charge it they are designed for miler ultras  still have plenty of battery so it should be ok for my little k runs so far is very good value solid product review man  concise and very helpful  how much did you pay for it usedi think the  is the perfect everyday runners watch not needed for someone starting but someone who wants to make running part of their lifestyle its such a great bang for buck only reason i updated was i had such a great deal and for future thinking pretty sure you can change the other screens too the workouts have been key for my mara training plan great review man ill be getting back to you on the hr soon going to give it a couple weeks to get some good baseline data i mention this in my next video coming so hope to have it in my week  video youthemanim about to get this watch second hand too like you hope its good have you ever had issues with it not syncing your runs to garmin connect im assuming not since you didnt say it in the videoyou are a very likeable guy great videohi does it simultaneously show the  data fieldstimedistancecurrent paceaverage pacethanksdvince not big on running but that watch sound pretty good i have like the first year fitbit for men and i do noticew when i use the gps and just it reading the steps i take and all it seems to be off and by a lot at times so i might consider getting this garmin thanks for you insight and review on it i have had my  for more than  years it does everything that i need with none of the gimmicks the battery life is still great even after a couple years it has enough juice for any singleday activities i have thrown at it but not enough if you want to track a multiday backpacking trip for example i find the heart rate actually works pretty well and was one of my reasons for getting this watch you do however have to go quite tight on the watch strap when im doing a workout ill go one notch tighter than normal to get accurate heart rate  its a tad uncomfortable at first but you get used to it quicklyhonestly the only thing i dont like is the charging clip not the connection itself  that i think is solid  but i have left the cable in more hotel rooms than i can count and getting a replacement is not easy its my favorite watch because its my only watch bro the review was greatyou are doing really go getting out of the normthis is a must tool for anybody who is into running like you it pretty much does everything do you wear it all the time or only when youre about to workout im definitely looking to an everyday watch with features like you said that i can also wear throughout the dayhi is itnworth buying one still looking to get a second hand oneheres one for the algorithm haha not a runner and not really in the market for a fitness watch but interesting to hear your thoughtsthinking of switching to this one over a fitbit charge  ive gotten into longer runs my max used to be k but im training for k and half marathons now and the fitbit just cant hold a long enough chargenice vinceexcited to get mine just ordered i want to use my tools not have my tools use me the more bells and whistles the more distracting it getsur awesome this was an awesome review so if i am going to run maybe a k every other day and bike also would you recommend getting this watchthanks anywayeditthis watch is strava compatible rightput it on looks hugecan you upload a track on the watch and then run iti used to have the garmin  then the garmin instinct  sold it and switched to a coros apex i love my coros  have you heard of corosi used to have a fitbit but i wasnt great at monitoring my results i gave it to my youngest daughter who is getting far more out of it than i ever didhey bro normally when you run do you use the gpsnormal or the gpsglonass i tried using both and it makes no difference when i runcan set this watch to permanently show my heart rate whilst on a  hour run beast modegreat informative video thanks a lot is this watch only for running though what if i wanted to cycle or do the elliptical can you change activities on itwill this sinc up to map my run my dad is looking to upgrade his original fitbit to this and that is a big thing fitbit didgreat content sir a worth watching and subbing channel will a chest strap monitor like polar h connect to this watch now this is my kinda video haha always trying to find out more about what other smartwatches have to offer i think the price isnt bad for what it seems to offer i hope youve checked out my smartwatches as well  good video and nice breakdown manciao e complimenti conviene il  o il  graziei still use it after  yearswill this accept audiobooks that have been put into mpcan i connect airpods to it to listen to music while running without my phonehow much did he pay for itif you have the gps does your phone need to be near youi race in duathlons run bike run  i need a watch that will record my first run then record my second run separately  most importantly i dont want to be fussing around with saving the first run and getting the watch ready to record the second run  does anybody know how i can accomplish these recordings with relative easemy phone gps broke on my last cell phone and i got some interesting maps when running heart rate is wack i have found hr monitor to be very polarized buy the screen protection ive had lots of falls on trails and its held up well  gps is responsive and accurate i love the custom face and utilize peter pacer single fieldsoh wow i cant believe it reads your heart rate at  that must have been scary the first time you saw that  youd basically be dead hahaha thanks for the tipswhat about swimming i surf and hate taking my watch on and offwhether the garminforerunner  is waterproof here we go love these topic videos and reviews had a fitbit

is for surenice and clear review i was about to buy a used one from marketplace but i would like it to have a touch screen and it does not have an option for trail running and soccer that i do plus it is a  modelmaybe a brand new huawei gte at the same cost would be a better ideagood review hand gestures a bit muchmgnnew frnd heredawg stop shaking that watch in my facethis watch has  more miles

testing here httpsdcrainfenixthis is a guy who has a job he loves and doesnt take it for granted thanks for the hours and hours of work to provide in depth reviews so we dont waste money on products that dont meet our prioritiesboom done absolutely no need to look elsewhere for a fenix  review this was totally perfect thanks dudewow that speedtalking class really paid offjust ordered pro  love the scenery where you are im former k and marathon runner  low s  now  yrs old so the larger screen and metrics will keep interest up i have two bulging duscs but running slower is less painful than walkiing great videolooking forward to the nacho cheese dispenserive been wanting solar on the fenixtactix models for a couple years now glad to see that they have started implementing itthe best written review ive ever read thanks for the hard work thank you for this went out and got one after watching this and couldnt be happier  thanksyou consistently do the best objective and most complete reviews most reviewers would completely miss the nacho cheese dispenserand their review would be substandard because of it thank younice review i really dig the pace pro feature on the fenix  unfortunately ive discovered that its limited to  miles as a maximum pace this is fine for most marathon runners but once you get into ultra marathons up to  miles in length only a small percentage of ultra runners are running that kind of pace most are in the  minutemile range i hope garmin can update this feature in garmin connectdude you are absolutely the best reviewer in the world and i hope you actually make money from all this hard work  i am not a sports buff by any means although ive done a few adventure races climbed mt kilimanjaro done santiago de compostelas way by bike etc but all for leisure  i have always been a fan of suunto and i not only love watching your reviews but also have recommended them to a lot of friends whoa are more athletes than me thank you and keep up the outstanding workyour reviews are always the best bought tacx neo then neo  fenix  fenix  and now  pro superb job thanks for this mega in depth review the most informative one ive seen yetgreat review

this and your website its where i check first before buying new gear  awesomesolid video  thanksthanks to your video i sold my fenix  and finally upgraded i was pretty happy with the fenix  but the enhanced mapping health metrics and improved battery life really won me over went with the fenix  sapphire this time around thanks dude learned a lot today i have the s and recently won a marq athlete a lot of the features on the  series also apply to my watchesray after all these years youre still the best thanks for having high quality reviews that are based off real analysis of product and function do you think theres going to be any impact to longevityquality of battery life in the x solar wconstant solar charging just seeing if yourre reading  yes great video i have the fenix x and have been waiting to see what the upgrades are the solar power looks super intriguing i hope this is something they really do continue to develop in a big waythank you mr rainmaker youve done a great job explaining about this watch ai have just purchased one and this video comes very handy much easier than reading the manual many thanksmazgreat review concise and no fluff how refreshing much better than a lot of reviewersyou are good at this congrats for the channelthis was so detailed  thank youthanks for the reviews i got a forerunner through your site based on your reviews  best in the businessgreat review once again i listened to you back in  when i saved all my gold pennies to buy a fenix xand now i am rather tempted by the x solar or the tactix  cant wait for christmas  thank you stay safe great review as always complex topic in a quick review ill read the full review tonight first impression is that garmin is getting way pricey their base model fenix which is now the pro is  what they are calling their base is really the same as their high end running watches but with the fenix look i am waiting for someone to change the market by providing a ish dollar watch with maps music training open water swim power meter connectivity and multisport mode there is no reason that couldnt be done except for some unwritten agreement that all these things are only in high end watches someone needs to break the cabalgood job thank you because of your review i bought one ill get it on monday the expedition feature will be great for mountaineering for an example a permit for aconcagua lasts three weeks and i will probably spend two weeks acclimatizing so not having to bring an additional charger is super convenientyou are a great content creator we learn very useful and detailed information on the web page or on the youtube channel i am very grateful for thatthank you so much for the video i love all your reviews and especially the indepth reviews helps me while deciding which clock to take i own a fenix  and i still like it i wont upgrade because of the pricetag but still i enjoy watching your reviews you are doing an incredible job thankswell prepared review with a sufficient amount of data for us well donedude beautiful nature in the backgroundquestion for youdoes the step counter remain accurate when using trekking poles ive been amazed at how few watches donacho cheese definitely need to upgrade from my hri originally got a samsung watch  classic and wasnt feeling it because of the battery life and size i went back to best buy and got myself a fenix x pro solar its worth every dollar im so in love with it i cannot complain for the price i just love that im going to get weeks of power before i have to recharge iti love your garmin reviews great videos and website when is the garmin fenix  pro review comingany idea the scratch resistance of the sapphire vs gorilla glass that is in the solar versions  im thinking about getting a x plus solar titanium and was wondering about the scratch resistance of the gorilla glass  also any idea if a screen protector would interfere with the solar capabilities of the glass  thanks in advanceray could you inform me on the scratch resistencydurability differences between sapphire and other glass editions how big of a difference is itgreat review as always thankslove my fenix x have no complaints about it but once the price drops on the solar model  a little ill be buying thatgreat video is it worth upgrading from my fenix  yet im not really limited by the  at all but it would be nice to have something faster with legit storage on itcant wait to see some of this on a vivoactive a thorough and impressive review thanksreally good review man keep it upthroughout the most of video i was sure my old garmin is good enough but the nacho cheese dispenser changed my mindim not sure if you know the mtb youtuber skills with phill but you two speak almost with the exact same tone and intonation  great work as always love your in depth videosas always very informative videos and the superindepth review thanks for doing what you do and keeping the rest of us updated on all this techyou have made me realise i would use  of the features but looks greatgreat review but my f has already so many features i dont need or use why pay more for more things i dont use eg popularity routing leads me along main roads although i live in the woods or the navigation which i used only to try it out what i need is navigation along a predefined track the maps accurate gps and flawless connection to the sensors the rest is nice or even uselesssuper solid review  thank you siri get a strange amount of satisfaction delving into something i know i could never afford xt is as high as i managed but one simply cannot pass a milestone dc rainmaker review love my fenix  awesome for triathlons maybe the s will go on sale now hi ray nice review  are the increased data fields coming to the   thanks nice video i just bought my fenix   days ago because it had a big discount and im glad i bought it because it still has everything i need with a bargain price thanks to the fenix the video been very helpful  but give us your advice we should go for fenix   or the marq edition  if were you what u will choose  thanks added nacho cheese dispenser awesome hahahaha nice video mangonna buy it just for the nacho cheese dispenser take my money garmingreat work just need to work out in the next few days which one to get waiting for a swim run in open water i really interested to accuracy of this watch vs the apple watch  that was way better than the garmin  during your testa great review as ever  fantastic location  watch is looking good   maybe its time to upgrade from my fenix  hr  thats the watch sorted now can i have your lifeim gonna bet that the expedition mode will be a huge hit with the military persons thats the sole reason that im considering this over the xgreat video massively helpful thanksthanks for big effort and great worki was waiting for cheese dispenser from fenix  finaly it heregreat information  i am hoping this brings down the price of the  plusthanks for so detailed review although i am not native english speaker but your full review really helps me before buying these watchesgreat review thanksthanks man great video as usual this new garmin is impressive but i am afraid i will wait a little so the price decrease a little i took advantage of a discount price to get my most recent fenix  plus garmin has finally truly jumped the shark with this thanks for the review im goodgreat review as always i have just placed an order for garmin  sapphire because it is half price deal at the moment in australiaexpedition mode looks awesome i think people do actually use it thats what i need for when i do a  week trip into the mountains my battery pack wont last that longnice insight as always ray great to see some detail on the new features particular the nacho cheese machine does that add extra weightexempt for the solar feature am staying with  plusthank u for your work awesomegreat review thanksstill really think a seiko kinetik style charging would make the most sense for watches for running and hiking in the winter i always have the watch under my clothing to save battery and avoid cooling the wrist so during the part of the year when topping up the battery is needed solar wont helphaha that subtitle on  what an awesome guy thanks for the reviewlove all your tech watch reviews dc although i have only watched the ones for the watches i am purchasing i was trying to decide between the f and f solar i just returned my instinct solar it did have great battery life but the display for me did matter somewhat and its not pretty lol so i went with the f sapphire wasnt sure i needed the solar feature as i am not really a huge hiker i have read that the display on the sapphire is slightly more clear then the solar version because the solar has that extra layer for catching rays can you confirm this or deny whichever all goodi cant wait to get my nacho cheese dispenseryes i am reading thanks for the video  i have s and absolutely dont see any need to upgrade its expensive and i think my s will at least last for another  yearswas a nice one thanks dudethey should have a solar wristband imo tons of realestate my epilepsy is activatedsuch a great review thumbs uphow is screen response time compared to fenix  series it often was quite slow to respond especially if you hadnt touched the buttons for a whilechanged playback speed to x perfectill stick to my fnix hr the  was cool but didnt really offer anything new the  just cost too much and the base model is a downgrade honestly the only thing on my wishlist is longer battery life id like some software updates i miss some features my polar v haddidnt expect to be nd amazing review was hoping for wireless charging but got solar charging instead not sure how i feel about thatincredibly review i know its been awhile since this review but do you recall while tracking specifically hiking activities and having any discrepancies with the heart rate i keep seeing issues on garmin forums and reddit about issues with the ohr while hiking specifically and its concerning me that a currently  watch is unable to perform hr tracking on a hike thanks also the watch being mentioned is the garmin fenix x i guess the other s have not had this issuelike and comment for the amount of effort put into your work still repping a fremantle tri club hatthe ncd is what sold me on this nacho cheese dispensergreat review if only this exact watch was a casio g shock brand with added bar water resistance id buy it in a heartbeatcant wait to eat my cheese on thatfolks im glad to introduce the garmin fenix x which now in addition to solar now has a kinetic dial in the back of the watch which rapidly charges your watch if youre running  is it me or has the progress of innovation since the original fenix  become quite boring beyond the fenix  hrliked and subscribed  youve been my stopshop in determining what to buy since you started your website  just now subscribed because i heard the like and subscribe comment around the ms mark  wouldve subscribed sooner but i didnt know you had a youtube channel in addition to your website both which are very well doneadded nacho cheese despenser i like it good humor hahahasurprisingly it still cant toast bagels and clean dishes after cooking maybe with coming firmware updatehow many years can i expect to get out of this watch under normal use time hiking etcawesome video so comprehensive quick question how much tougher is the sapphire glass compared to the solar glass for the x progreat video as always sir to your knowledge and experience how strong is the power glass vs the saphire glass since the solar watch only has power glass i am concerned about damaging the screen when i am out and about being active mainly smacking into objects around me as i move and sometimes move quick tia new things that you will never need but we put them in the watch anyway because you know we have to take your money somehowi would already be glad if it would count my pool laps correct  my fenix  sucks at itas always such a descriptively helpful review however on given option which watch would you prefer personally for your training  fitness polar vantage v titan or garmin fenix x pro solar  proviso when no strings are attached thanksall the alpsa lot of this is strictly software related and should honestly be included in the prior fnix linethanks for hastening your speech in order to fit the review in lots of super good info you earned a subawesome ray when garmin said the new  features will not be coming to the series  it was obvious a  was on its way with these featuresthat sucks that they dont offer sapphire with solarnacho dispenser yes im reading this excellent job well done hey dc rainmaker ive been watching and reading all your reviews about fenix  suunto  polar grit x and coros  they all are good watches but cant see which one would be the most accurate in terms of purely gps and data specially for mountains activities and running if we dont look at the rest they are offering any advise  thanks for your workgood review but i dont see why anyone would buy this over the  plus the added features are just kinda uselessonly just bought the fenix x plus fuuck dont you just hate it when that happenshey thanks for great videos i currently use a wahoo element when mountainbiking and an apple watch for everyday use for overall health and fitness but i have started looking at a garmin instinct or garmin fenix x to replace my wahoo and use as a training watch whats the pros and cons compared to my bike computer and apple watch cant decide which way to go i really love my apple watch but miss some fitness functionscould you make a comparison between the new watch and the forerunner  music im interested in activity tracking in particularwarning to anybody about to buy fenix  pro has very poor accuracy even in moderate reception conditions i mean you dont have to be in thick woods to experience this for example   even on a totally straight paved road with trees on both side of the road your running pace could be off by  sec per kilometer this is not normal once youre on the clear though it is as accurate as previous fenix line watches i have compared it with having three different fenix watches at the same time one on each arm  one in my hand and with different settings gps alone gpsglonass gpsgalileo and of course im using  sec as the measurement interval my son has exactly the same watch and it has exactly the same accuracy issues so its not just my watch thats brokencould you please slow down when you talking its  struggling for me to understand the device and hearing you talking and reading the text at the same timejust a question only the mm watch have the  data fields for my wrist i think is a big watch so im thinking in the mm but like the data fieldsalways great reviews would like to see compassion between marq polar v  and this lineup  how good is the wrist hr on the new finex  thank you againthe base model seems like a downgrade  and it wont even show maps might as well get the instinct instead for pretty much garmin is making customers confused way too many options the solar option is  really garmin and you get no music maps or wifi what kind of lineup is this how about including the heart rate strap or the tri strap or another stupid expensive  garmin watch straphello sir thank you for amazing videos ive learned a lot from them i have one question i used to wear my watch fenix  pro on my right wrist now i am wearing it on my left wrist but i cant find anywhere to change it in strength section is there anything i can do i have no idea many thanks farzadgreat review as always buddy something i have wondered is just how scratchproof is the solar version i mean based on the fact that if you own the x pro solar you are going to use it outdoors the majority of the time meaning it is going to be more susceptible to knocks and bangs etc i cannot understand why sapphire crystal was not used in that version i find that just plain strange is the gorilla glass more resistant than the sapphire glassjust seeing if youre readingyou need to talk fasterexcellent reviewgreat overview of the new fenix i am reading still px underwhelmingslow down youre almost impossible to understandhey this is a fantastic film thank you i have just bought a fenix  pro for general health and fitness tracking but i do not use a smartphone can i still use the majority of the watch features with garmin express and garmin connect on a windows pc i have done this with a vivosmart  but i wondered if i could use the fenix in the same waygreat reviewhave had the hr for some time now and never enough change for me to upgrade getting closer now also have the  cycling head unit and have had the same upgrade hold pattern would love to see that next gen would be good if it included solargreat review im looking at one n what do you suggest for me im a mountain biker walker n hiker thankshi dc  i have a question  will the pacepro come to older models  i bought the fenix x plus  spent some time looking for it and dont see it  just curious as to if you had any inside knowledgehey there question for you between the fenix  pro and apple watch  which would say has the more accurate hr and gps not a hardcore athlete but these accuracies are important to me thank youhi is it possible to still see the pace heart rate ect while you follow the gps routes can you change between the options while running i hope this makes sensei got excited when i read about the nacho cheese dispensersnap on runs yay then i read the just checking farming needs to incorporate this featurevaaary comprehensive dankejust got x pro monster of a watchi just ordered a x sapphire cant wait to use the nacho cheese dispenser and auto pilot good video thank you perhaps you could do a test from a runners point of view regarding the distance measured by the fenix  there are reports in the garmin forum that the  measures the wrong distance during the run so on a staked route the fenix probably does not show a distance of  km for some but  meters less in each case this falsifies the pace sure a stryd can make up for that but can you confirm this discrepancy allegedly the fenix is said to have recorded the distance too short even after the run i would be happy about your experiences a video would be greatyour review makes me wanna buy it even if i dont need itwhat battery should garmin  pro last for  the standard pro versionalso do you have a video on how to setup the watch and also change the pin button modes which model do you wear on each wrist at the beginning of the videosolid sharingi love the new added nacho cheese dispenser great watchwow didnt expect to see the garmin fenix  series out this earlyi guess we can officially sayexpect a new fenix series every two years with a plus model in between each of those yearsalso two year update cycle for the  etci like italso i cant wait for all the new garmin hrm chest straps with bluetooth hopefully there is also a wrist band to compete with the polar ohhi ray i wondered if you or anyone else knew of a way to extend the time the backlight comes on for when you press the light button on the fenix  ive hunted all the menus and internet and cant find anything thankshi ray big fan thanks for all the reviews youve done over the years  im looking at purchasing a fenix x sapphire now that the prices have dropped dramatically  are they still a good watch or is the tech now a bit dated appreciate your thoughtshello have you had a chance to test swim tracking accuracy  for both pool and open water swimmingnice vids thank you bought a fenix  silver thanks to you dwill the estimated sweat loss feature be coming to the fenix and what other features are expected can you get the storm alerts while you record an activity like runningdcrainmaker did you said climb pro is available on the garmin hi thank you for the video i actually have a garmin fenix  sapphire however all settings on garmin are very similar can you please help me with the dual grid on how to keep it on display as when its activated on the ground it seems to return to my watch face having me press the gps button again for coordinates which is not beneficial for my line of work many thanks i will look forward to your responsenacho cheese dispensergoldnice vid question fenix x or suunto  for mainly hikingbackpacking to track pace and other hiking metricsalso any rumors about upcoming releasesgreat video hi does the temperature sensor fixed  and give ambient weather cheers mate nice onecan you send and receive waypoints by wifi or bluetooth for example mark a waypoint on my fenix x and send it to other garmin devices thank youjust got issued one of these for free never had a smort watch trying to learn about it pretty cool so farwhat is youre wrist width in cm thank you for this videoi am so looking forward to getting me some nacho cheese xd thank you dc for a super useful informative and indepth review  i am mostly interested in the tactix delta but as far as i can gather it is the same as the fenix x pro in all but the design  a few tacfeaturesquality vidi have a garmin  that works perfectly and is  years old how often would you suggest upgrading a garmin watchgotta love that nacho cheese dispenser lolpolar vantage v is my favourite hi do you know if the hiit from the venu  is also available on the fenix  or on the garmin appkind regards jimmyyou are awesome solid reviewjust subscribed awesome video  love the nacho cheese dispenser   i paused the video garmin needs to sponsor youim visually impaired but cycle a lot im thinking of getting the f or  do any of the garmin watches have gradient so i can see how steep a climb isthatbackdropthough  dangrainmaker you are one likeable dude  and nacho cheese haha if only thanks for all the infoive paused to read on   i have a question is  gorilla glass scratch resistant enough i have phones for years and do not see any scratches on thesehi ray thanks for the review what does the increased resolution on the  and x translate to in terms of view ability do the colors pop more or are they more vibranthi dc  maybe you will have a little bit more info about fenix  orand  pro  got frustrated with vantagem when it comes to winter profiles and wondering if not to change for garmin thanks for a very good overview do you know if fenix uses barometer for altitude measurements or gps signal or is it possible to choosei ask because barometer from fenix  had always an issue after hard water contact for some period of time when swimming in calc water or just every day shower with fixed value m or m and it gets people sad that in the middle of their training barometer go crazy and whole training is brokenjust a thought iown a garmin instinct and the open water swimming gps tracking  sucks is that any better in the will try out the x pro solar but gshock have had solar for a good while with very strong build and sapphire so i hope garmin not go low end stuff for that price i was wondering if the garmin varia smart lights are compatible with the fenix x pro solarim curious about some of the information you provided on the battery life what does the smartwatch mode include i kind of figured it would include full functionality but upon adding gps and music it drops im wondering what features are bundled into that smartwatch category thank youi just bought garmin fnix  sapphire after watching this hope it will meet the expectationsnacho cheese dispenser yayhi buddy would i be right in assuming the fenix  pro solar edition is the best at the moment for multisport use i am currently also looking at the tactix delta series for no other extra reason other than its a very cool watch yep i understand its probably overkill but your thoughts on the two watches would be appreciated thanks niceim still looking for that added nacho cheese dispenser wow that is some watch a watch for galileohe was the first person to wear a clock on a chain around his neck  what do you think about the medical datadoes it do a good job sleep data blood pressure monitorgreat review  thanksgood video thank you perhaps you could do a test from a runners point of view regarding the distance measured by the fenix  there are reports in the garmin forum that the  measures the wrong distance during the run so on a staked route the fenix probably does not show a distance of  km for some but  meters less in each case this falsifies the pace sure a stryd can make up for that but can you confirm this discrepancy allegedly the fenix is said to have recorded the distance too short even after the run i would be happy about your experiences a video would be greatkiller feature  nacho cheese dispenserlooking at a fenix  base for my first watch looking for health monitoring features for runninghikingweightlifting not interested in maps and not looking for wifi connectivity current sale price is in my range and i like the look of it dont want an apple watch any input is welcomedwould you get garmin marq athlete or fenix  pro solargreat review  went to order one but i want solar with the sapphire glass but you cant get it with solar is this correcthaving a suunto  which is big and kind of just a different looking ambit  would you recommend going for a fenix s pro i miss the round trip routing map navigation and more data analytics suuntos app is really behind the competition and i hate being dependent of a computer to be able to update your suunto will i be happy with the fenix or is there not that much of a difference with regards to the suunto i hope the wrist hr is better than suuntos tooreally great video as usual  i have a few questions for dc rainmaker and also other peoplewould you go for the fenics x with sapphire glass or with a solar panel does the sapphire glass make a big difference in terms of scratches and durability i would mainly use it for runninghey thanks for the content will like to get your opinion on having the fenix x as a bike computer mounting it on the bike what do you think about that for a starter take care there man you are the bestlooks amazing what is the combination of that watch in the vid where it has like a green tinge on the bezelnacho cheese dispense eh  that is a good one  lolexpedition mode might just be useful for first time solo hikers who are kinda afraid theyll lose their way in the forestmountainsi am in a plan and need to do k tomorrow but i have to choose the session or to run with pacepro which is what i want to do if i run with pacepro will detect garmin coach as a training session of the dayi recently purchased the vivoactive  but unfortunately i sent it back due to the  vibration notification when receiving a text or a phone call garmin informed me that it will only vibrat  times due to trying to safe battery life i would like to have the option for it to vibrate  or  times or  to  seconds i discovered the issue when i was working out missed very important calls due to the  fast vibration which only last  second i was going to order the fenix  but they said that its program to do the same way have you had this issue and if you have how can it be fixes for the cost of the smartwatches i should dictate how many seconds or how many times it should vibrate not garmin please let me know your thoughts thank youbeautiful backgroundhi dcr i need to replace my garmin forerunner  xt what would be a good replacement thanksi subscribed to you because of this videodyou know if the display resolution was improved at all with f  i wonder if the watch face is able to now emulate a real watch hand if say an analog face is chosenhi i went to see yr web site but when i clicked on activity tracker  heart rate sensors didnt see those without a chest belt models from garmin n apple r those accurate looking at garmin venu or something thanksi just got the x plus  didnt know the x was availablegreat thanksive been trying to pick the perfect watch after my previous died and im having trouble making a decision ill be using the watch for running biking weight training indoor rowing golf and hiking im leaning towards the x as i want something durable and will last for years however im not sure if the sapphire screen is worth the extra money if you get some time i would greatly appreciate your feedback on this i also checked out your website great reviewhow scratch resistant is the solar glass i did some research and apparently the glass is gorilla glass it didnt mention which generation ray any inputx pro a good upgrade over the fenix  i wonder been waiting for a replacement for agesdo they finally support the unicodecharacterdoes it have the same problem with abc like the x where the altitude barometer temperature sensor fail after few months i had to swap my old x about  times under warranty because of this altimeter barometer temperature failure issuei would love to get a new fenix watch just because of all the featuresproblem is though my fenix  is still working as amazing as ever and these new watches are super expensive will buy as soon as i win the lotterythought you were wearing a kippa at first then i saw it was your sunglasses anyway great video thanks how many gps systems is it using at once all three or still only dude where are you at  very nice view and also very good video about the watchyou had me at nacho cheese dispenserdoes garmin update any of these new features to felix  devicesdo you think  will get the swimming hr featurehi dc rainmaker i have one question about the solar fenix x if you turn it off and leave it in the sun does it charge your watch and thank you for the reviewawesome reviews you should be paid for thatcan i set my marq to those widget glances  cant find it in the settingsdc quick question i just got the fenix x plus from rei should i return it and get this i upgraded from the  mostly for the pulse ox but its miserably slow to measure i am a ultra runner thanksi took the plunge and got this after watching a few videos about it including all of yoursone thing i cant figure out the weather widget shows the temperature in f by default but im in canada and familiar with c cant find anywhere to change it anyone knowyou know if the hr during the open water y the same the using the hr bandhey i have an apple watch  is it worth making the shift to this model i play a lot of tennis and moderate weight trainingpls do let me knowhido you  know beside to save battery time why is the apple watch heart rate sampling is set at  mins and how is this compare with the polar or garmin continuous heart rate in usefulnessthanks the whr senor lights are not coming on is there an activation i am missing or is there a fault issuenacho cheese great vid as expectedgreat thankshello rayhave an question a couple of weeks ago the fenix  got an update after that theres a new feature in garmin connect walkrun its measures if you walk or run or inactive during a run but the data isnt right how can i change thatwould have loved to see how the x prosolar with its sony gps chip fairs against its prior modellast week i purchased the x plus come to find out the fenix  will be released next week at rei if the gps tracking on the xsolar equals or surpasses its predecessor ill return the  and pay the extra  for the  solaru saved me few seconds for me to sleepthe boss has spokenwhat is h  l on watch face solar hello i have heard that gps in fenix  is worse than in fr and fenix  i have seen some comments that it is because of new sony gps chip or because metal bezel in f can you let me know if you noticed any issues in that area for f if you compare fr f and venu which one has the most accurate hps trackingso what is the durability of the new solar glass compared to the sapphirehi you compared the same track in the same time between mediatek  for example x plus and new sony chipset in the polar vantage v is very very inaccurate after one yearbased on your review i think the best watch for myself is the fenix x based on features and price  i can buy a brand new x from a us authorized garmin retailer for  on sale  while its great that the new  series has some neat features the x is still more watch than the lower line of the  series unless you want a smaller watchsize matters   my suggestion is to pick up a fenix x while supplies last as i dont see the lower line of the  series as being a game changer  in my opinion the  series would have been a game changer if it had return texting and return phone call optionany words on pushing the  or  displays on the older fenix x plus modelis it using the ecg sensor for the heart ratedid you say that the solar option is not available with sapphiredc i am an enduro dirt bike ride what is the best watch for me i do like lap timing hr gps to track etc what do you recommendwhen do we going to have a review about suunto dont be too quick to dismiss the expedition gps mode i plan to use it who wants to carry a powerbrick when camping not mei was excite about this watch but unfortunately the garmin express was unable to update anything on the watch and i had to return itis the hr and step counter accuratecant wait to get it but i just wanted to ask do you think its safe to buy it as soon as they release it its not released in my country yet or should i wait some time im worried about some possible problems with it since it is brand newexcellentreally nice watch but if you dont like scratches on the screen then get the sapphire one i crashed dragging my screen against the pavement without a scratch on the screenhow about the coros vertix im hesitated between the vertix and fenix tatbedankt expedition mode would be useful for ocean sailors as yet another duplicate system for recording locationgreat video i now notice that pacepro has been introduced for the garmin fr  as well perhaps more models tooedit i see it on connect but dont know how to export it to the watch edit  says garmin  not compatible perhaps a software update will do the trickbest smartwatch on marketdo i need to make my garmin fenix  always connected to iphone bluetooth to get metrics of running or can it auto upload it when i go back home via wifi i am not using phone notification on watch just the metricsis the quality of the music on spotify any different from the predecessor i found after testing the fenix  plus side by side with an iphone that the fenix  plus uses some other lower quality codec for either bluetooth connection or it downsamples the tracks for it to fit in the internal memory it was notable enough for me with my jaybird x that i actually returned the device has it changed any or is it the samewhat about screen resolution x  do you see difference are you training for utmblooks good but the  is lighter and that makes it sweeter  im good to go for a whilenacho cheese dispenser is really worth it dmy garmin s rose gold is finally arriving tmr after waiting for more than  months i cant wait to use the nacho cheese dispenser on it hehe jkanyone know what the number is that shows up straight after a workout ive seen  but doesnt necessarily seem to correlate to the intensityi guess this watch is probably outdated by now  but i was hoping i could get some input i want a new watch primarily for running but also everyday use the garmin fenix  and the polar vantage m are now almost the same price in my country i much prefer the look and weight of the m but everybody loves the fenix series so much would it be stupid to buy the m when theyre essentially the same price if i do what do i miss out on hoping some kind folks would be able to advice me great review just wondering is it a little less model more suitable for lronman eventsits really nice but in just got the garmin marq expedition it just stands out the look is a lot more premiumdid you test whether the solar actually solar chargethank you very much for this  but these are not out yet  lucky you got to review them and see them before anyone else got the chance  private viewing before the movie premiere  i recently got the xt  it was very unreliable inaccurate and not worth carrying it i am too wary of touching garming of any kind with a barge polethanks ray do you think garmin might introduce other variants such as di want it for the cheese dispenserive seen the specs on garmins website and ive noticed it doesnt have the swimming pace alerts like the swim  does do think this is something that will be added in future software updates id like to buy this watch but i want all the swimming features availabledoes the fenix  pro have the blue tint to the screenexpedition mode may be used by through hikers hiking the pct or atso whats with the delay in the pro solar  titanium with vented titanium bracelet politely asking cause the website still has this thing on  week expected shipping dc rainmaker you got any connections over there at garmin heeeeeeelp thanks dudewhere are uthe background location is amazinghiis it just me or everyone face the same issue seems that i always has to use my polar oh arm sensor pair with garmin to get a proper heart rate reading or else the hr data is completely offdoes anyone know if the x still limits the number of connect iq data fields per activity i have a x which im pretty sure is limited to  iq fieldsi think i heard you say theres a rd party app that allows you to respond to texts on iphone with fenix i have fenix x plus did i hear correctly or no if so whats the app thank you love the videosat the moment i have fenix plus sapphire today i checked  and dummy x and i am impressed by the new software layout it is much more modern and clean i decided to switch  however i cannot decide between  and x is it true that in x is able to show more data on one screen if yes i will turn to x price difference is  euro which i think is worth extra screen and battery it is much smaller than x which was bulky with this small screenexactly a year after i bought fplus they release this beautyskipping for now plus is amazinghi ray is it worth buying x pro these days i mean that maybe a successor is already on the way enduro is not for me mainly because i need the music and maps what do you think x pro is almost  years old  lte is not available in our countrygarmin x pro now  off because people realized that theres no nacho cheese dispenser thanks for the heads up excellent reviewsooo this nacho cheese dispenser tho i want a taste test lolnacho nacho man can you tell me what material the back of this watch is made of is it nickel freetylike the other nick looking forward to the nacho cheese dispenser i bet theyll be small nachos thennb nb   playback speed x really helpful dthanksdo you still feel like the gps is accurate ive had my garmin fenix x pro solar for several months now and it isnt as accurate as the coros apex pro or my friends garmin watches who are wearing older fenix models is there something that will help correct this issue perhaps a calibrationso which to buy a s pro or the new  as someone who is purely a runnercan someone please help i have a garmin  hr and im looking to upgrade but cant see if the sensors in the new models are different of if they are just interpreting the data in more ways  thanksso with that popularity feature does it upload location data to a server id get this watch if it was passive gps only no location data sharedhave someone tried to pair with bluetooth headphones with  version because fenix x is with  version i would like to buy headphones with  version but im not sure if they will connect together in a good qualitymmmm nacho cheese dispenser is the best ever featurecan anyone help i have a fenix  i have set myself a goal of cycling km this year through the web version of connect how do i get that goal to the dashboard of the app or even onto the watch itselfdoes pacepro only work on the  or does it also work on the  plus as wellgreat reviewdo they plan to add fenix  features into forerunner can you apply the sapphire lens to a regular garmin fenix  d great vidpretty cool technology with the solar instinct solar is more practical with solar imo rather have it than not on the fenixwill a vivoactve  br rrleasedjust bought a fenix  pro oh man im just imagining what my recovery would be like if i added nacho cheese  x pro vs apple watch series  optical reader i run my heart rate no strap on this morning heart rate run my garmin alerted me i was high at  which is good but it just kept going higher top off at  meanwhile wearing apple watch on other wrist the rate showed i was at  and based on my breathing and talking the  is correct people on facebook are telling me get a strap which is not a problem but do you see a trend with optical sensors on garmin watches i like the convenience of the optical sensor but thats a big difference when you run by heart rate thanks for listeningnacho cheese dispenser nacho cheese dispenser  at lastso the fenix  is on saleits got a built in nacho cheese dispenser  soldi ordered one for my daughter and shes excited about the nacho cheese dispenserbut do you run with your watch facing towards sunnext video idea i was curious if a us purchased garmin polar or suunto watch maps would work straight away in europe or another part of the world as a triathlete who travel to the european championships and back to kona hawaii i want to be able to use my running watch without having to pay and download new maps to it garmin i know charges  ridiculous for each country map using garmin express is there a watch that has it allgonna upgrade my fenix  no hr with a base  no need for fancy wifi music or maps the longer battery duration snappier os and increased ppi will be a nice upgrade from the base i wonder if garmin has fixed the bug in training with garmin connect which model do you show at  dose the garmin fenix x pro gps watch  black case with black band  can you chance the watch face to look your dog and so on dose it have a feature where it has sleep tracker i know you said in the video its got a heart tracker ive got like  bucks comeing and i want a really good watch but no rolex  so yeah good if you could answer them questions please i was going to get the casio gshock gps solar rangeman watch find out by videos that was just a big gps watchyou are the go to guy for these reviews i purchased a garmin instinct after one of your videos and it was perfect for hiking and biking and running i only wish theyd add a surf option without buying a new watch but the fenix  seems like a good upgrade and has surf capabilitiesstupid question but does it have to be connected to your phone to use the gpscan anyone tell me if the garmin vivoactive  would still count steps in watch mode or low power modewish they give the s the polar glass too  have no choice but to stay with my sis it brighter greatso no saphire for the solar model does it come with  batteries constant charging should be bad for the main battery so having a different power source for the solar panel would be smartno one does reviews like dcanyone knows if there is tide indicator for hight tide or low tide thanksq is the glass in the solar model as good as the sapphire glass i love my sapphire glass and probably wont give it up for the solar model if it isnt as scratch resistanthow to setting fenix  in detail to show our vomaxadded nacho cheese dispenser lolfyi the ball size for miniature golf and big ball golf are the samegreat review thank you im on the fence between the x or the  plus at the momentive never been to your channel before and this is the first video ive seen by you so i thought maybe this admittedly unsolicited feedback would be particularly valuable i couldnt understand what you were saying in the first  seconds the majority of the problem was a lack of diction everything was rushed together and thats understandable given the pressure to get in a catchy intro as quickly as possible but i was entirely deterred from wanting watch this because of this issue what if the rest of the video is difficult to understand im willing to bet that there are others with this experience just my two cents but i imagine improving on this could help expand your subscriber base especially since the thumbnail for this vid was attractive so im assuming others are of similar quality you already have a pretty solid subscriber count so youve got some authority on your side and you or your team seem to know your way around equipment and filming all the best to you and for your channelupgrading now must have that nacho cheese dispenseri like that  widgets per page hope that comes to connect iqwhy doesnt garmin ever make features reverse integrate  i spent good money on a descent mk ti and  it would be great to get some of these features without having to spend another hey do you see any issues with the screen contrast for the fenix  series i have a s sapphire and my husbands  sapphire has a blacker screen my s sapphire has this ugly blue color to it do you think i should return it and wait for the next fenix to come out do you think fenix s plus will be coming out this yeardoes it operate on the metric system as wellhow can i set a countdown timer for minsgarmin is going the way of how mobile phone manufacturers are marketing and pricing their flagship phonesnacho cheese dispenser i dont understand what the advantage of widget glances is they show very little information compared to a fullscreen widget and due to the circular screen you generally have to scroll to the widget youre interested in in particular in order to see what little information it does show all i find that this achieves in effect is to put another press of the start button between the user and the first full page of the widget after scrolling to itdoes it have built in thermometer can it sense real time temperaturecopying a feature is a tough thing to say i have seen very similar ideas coming up from people in completely different companies and fields one company was faster in implementing but it doesnt mean its a straight copy like the solar and wrist based hr for swimming i hope they fixed the terrible job the fenix x plus does sleep recording i use my hr for that i probably wont use a lot of the other new features garmin needs to stop trying to have an allinone thousand dollar watch they should split their watches to adventure social and sportsactivity trackers the solar watch will extend backpacking performance timedoes garmin update software and firmware over timeso solar needs direct sunlight indoor light wont workhow does this work within an apple eco system who converted from an apple watch to garmin and what are the pros and consi want that nacho cheese dispenser if it is titanium  i need the nacho cheese dispenser d perfect for the long runsnachossounds like a nice upgradei wish they would fix garmin connect yaxis to be scaleable like the xaxis so you can actually see pace intervals and the entire software actually be of some use this is  garmin how can you have so much great hardware and useless softwarenacho cheese dispenser hahaall i want is a bike version of the overlanderwhy theres no option to speak via bluetooth on watch its just perfected but as a smartwatch this is needed only who used that before who can get what i mean thx for you effort matejust like yourself im an american living in europe and would prefer to buy my stuff in the us with the fenix s pro if bought in the us how do i get all the europe maps downloaded is this a reason to buy the s pro in europe the price difference these days is stiff thanksi think alot of people will find the expodition mode very useful battery pack wont help much if you need to carry a custom cable to charge the device granted its not very space consuming but stillmore than  data fields on screen maybe i have to replace my good old fenix hr some time soonwhat a lvoely place for a run where is this thanksi so regret buying an iwatch last year coming from garmin fenix  since it came out without heart rate seeing this video now its like wow feature after feature too bad the top model prices have doubled since thencan map other countries canaddyou had me at nacho cheesewhat is your wrist size do you prefer  pro or xyoure great yup youre greatshould i wait for the  in a few monthsdo the solar have a sapphire screenthe reason you saw more running versus hiking could be because of the big issues that garmin acknowledges but hasnt fixed with the hiking sport profilebought the sapphire x to upgrade my fenix  and the contrast was horrible in comparison to my older device more grey than black straight on and at an angle returned it and waited bought another from a different vendor and it too had a similar screen returned that one too i see all of these reviews with nice black backgrounds and wonder where they are getting themnacho cheese dispenser what is that lolwhats the release datehow does the cheese dispenser worksno

always a brilliant review how did  trolls get on here every review from dc rainmaker is excellentbetter choice between fenix  pro solar or fenix x pro for the same pricethe improved gps signal

about garmin watches is they try to show as much information on  screen  other watches you have to keep scrolling does garmin try to scam its user with a premium service like fitbitwhat is the best garmin to buy if money is not an issueyoure closer to the satellites up there  better gps trackinglol nacho dispenser feature would be craaaazy what mountains are thosei gave up on garmin my fenix x sapphire glass had a mm scratch that garmin said they would not cover under warranty saying i must have scratched it with a diamond when its never been near a diamond i highly doubt their sapphire is of standard scratch resistent quality i have owned many luxury watches with sapphire and this is the first to scratch so badlythis dude has two watches on in watch review  promy garmin x  steals from a distance compared to a x x showed me  km and x showed me  km which was the real distance  i belive next i will buy coros but i need muscso solar cant work through sapphire that is interesting  highest cost model has to drop back to gorilla glasswould love one but the price is too highoh man not even a year passed and now i need to find another  bucks to spend on a new watch got this watch

saphire version which worked for me in previous versions solar is just not worth itcan i get a fenix  for cheap nowdo the fenix  watches auto track your activies like apple watch does showing you your calories burned activity stepsetc not sure who would actually use this feature  to me it really seems the  day life span comes down to a survival feature for the disaster scenario hope you never need it but shtf and you wind up on a deserted island somewhere you can drop to the low power mode and conserve power longer  knowledge of where you are is the most important thing you could have if your trying to find your way back to civilization in a disasternacho cheese dispenseri think they could afford to increase that  mm solar to  or  mm with bigger impactdoes the solar model recharge the

recieve notifications i spent eur and in my opinion i pretend that its something very basic to recieve sms phone call or an email in a watch like this so be sure before you spend lot of money for this watchnacho cheese dispenserslow down man we enjoy your videos even if you make them a few minutes longer no need to talk like a new yorker avez vous les explications en franais svploved the video and the information irritated by the fast talking damn man take a breathall the alpsnachosgarmin fenix  pro solar still good for i just purchased a garmin fenix x pro watch that did not turn on after sitting on garmins chat support line for  minutes i learned that they have no idea how to turn the watch on either i asked to return the watch which i bought from the garmin website and got the runaround that i didnt try their troubleshooting tips i tried everything they asked i just want the watch to work as advertisedim sincerely disappointed in how garmin handled this situation tom who is probably not really tom was a complete jerk to me in our chat session not once did he offer any helpful information instead he asked me two questions again and again do you want help troubleshooting or would you like to return the item my advice avoid garmin at all costslooks good but still feel garmin never finish their watches the fenix  plus still full of bugs and unstable bluetooth haha nacho cheese dispenserthe way to think about itwait  months and buy it half offno miniature golf courses no buycan swimmers turn the nacho cheese dispenser offi have bought this watch after the review and i can tell you it ripped me seriouslya it stopped saving tracks and exercises  full resetb it started to consume its battery life in  hours to zero  full resetc it broke down several times whike using it for navigation in difficult terrain horribled it was not getting connections anymore after a time with  none devicee it couldnt connect to wifi either after  monthsjust premium priced bullfucmy dude went to skyrim to film this reviewwould you happen to know if a descent mk in the works dont have to tell me just give me a thumbs up so i know to sell the mk i just baught buttons been watching some reviews but really need one thats accurate else they can have  functions but useless when its not accuratemine didnt come with a nacho cheese dispenseryeah its not sponsored but you already have it ready with tests at the time garmin reveals it suregreat video  awesome overview and its great that you have actually been using it i  think it could be even better if you didnt  speak fast and mumble at the same time thoose two things dont go good together imo and the information can get lost ind monotone mumblingjust noticed hes wearing two watches     very detailed and cool review but i couldnt take it more than  mins and skippedyou speak too fast and bot cleari feel stressed after t  minutes if i close my eyes you sound like elmo from sesame street thanks for the detailed review great personal note youre fast paced you want to include a lot of details but youre difficult to followgreat review but dont drink so much coffee next time a little slower would help a lot if english is not your first languageim a little disappointed i thought the  came with lte or satellite emergency system to call the rescue and the ecg one drivation and not the upgrade to use the crdit card in high mountain ore the gb to listen music when you do a marathonuseless features i can think on the iwatch you could have with lte emergency call and ecg but not on a garmin too expensive too poor hardware innovationsi waited a lot for this fenix but now im thinking a lot of buying a x plus that now is cheaperbig ball golfroflvery informative but i missed so much because you talk so fast must have watched this  times nowdoesnt seem worth ditching the x plushope you do not mind my saying so good review but the very fast pace and amount of hand gestures in the presentation gives me anxietylove the watch but im not paying that muchgarmin never update an userfriendly thing before this is too old them have always been extremly slow with updatecan i make shawarma with that thingnacho cheese like for the swiss alpsmmmmmmm nacho cheese waste to spacegood but fewer words delivered more slowly would be betterbig ball golf you do realize its not the ball thats bigger right found out that the pro has no virtueel runner  a high end watch schould have it allthe forerunner has the virtueel runner wow cut down on the amphetamines is this watch really worth  man my fenix  just took a dumpi need to say this i bought x plus over  watch does not display korean garmin said i need to get east asian version if i want to see korean on thatwhat a great joke all i wanted just able to see letters from the phone returned got apple watch instead iwhy pay so much for a watch when the software behind it cant even add up the active calories you do from your daily activities this has been a problem for years all you have to do is look at the garmin forums httpsforumsgarmincomappssoftwaremobileappswebfgarminconnectwebactivecaloriesnotcalculatingwill spending  on a watch take  mins of my k pbi just received my x today and what you say about the screen is not true today it is very washed out very bluish i have seen some other people complain about this i will be returning it you might want to update everybody watching it seems to be hit or miss very disappointing for the moneyive just bought x plus can someone translate this to english please thxhey hey hey     hold your horses and slow down when you are presenting the watchyou sound like kermitgood review good editing etc but  the speed speak biting off wwords and sentences is way too much slow it down a bit calm down and the entire production will be better machine gun talk is not goodso the fenix  base range is a total downgrade from the x plus or  plus rangeother than the better screen the pro range has the same main features as the x plusbut better larger screen better battery life more storage and the solor has no sapphire crystali like the new larger screen but not worth over  for the privilegenumber    garmin will discontinue support in  year so you have to buy a new onehey sirioh waitare you moschittas sonanybody else having crazy cadence lock issues with this watch rendering it pretty much useless  along with the less than impressive usual garmin customer care can you not do that scroll through the review thing in the beginning where you scroll down your entire review super fast thats epilepsy triggering thanks for the review though much appreciatedstill dont know if you change the battery or can charge it    you might think that is important i definitely wont buy one if garmin wants to keep it a secret and another thing before you spent the big money try giving garmin a call to ask a question and did they give a shitgarmin is starting to remind me of enron what gimmicks are next how can i steal your moneyno speaker and no mic on this smartwatch so no answering the phone if your driving or just want to quickly ask google a question i guess they want you to buy your blue tooth earphone for that huh funny how they conveniently fail to mention things like thisgreat video but i must say that its quite hard to keep up with the speed of your speach you speak waaaay to fastwait no discussion of the heart rate accuracy or the new pulse ox oximeter tech and how it compares to the past massive oversight dudemore than half of the fenix  line production has a defective screen with a washed out bluish low contrast screen that includes the sapphire the only one worth getting is the delta tactixjesus can some please show what these watches can actually do doing a workout other than track your god damn heart ratei think garmin is going iphone way fenix  and beyond catch up if you cando they have sensors that go into the laces to help with foot strike and heel rise or uneven gait  or does the watch call out kilomtrage  is there an actual watch face  and do you look at both watches on either arm when you come from behind pass within a few mm and drop the laggard behind you like it was nothing  you scumbag  asking for a friendim going to skip this one for a tracker watch and they cant seem to figure out how to make the screen brighter and not pixelated samsung still has them beat with a  watch even fitbit has them beat and they are trash  shitty marketing stuff old x had  inch display new x has   its not  increaseonly  and for regular   vs   is even less how comewhy do you have to talk so freaken fastcan i shower with garmin fenix for non native english speaking people your talking speed is a tad difficult to followdo i win a prize for reading just seeing if you are readingfor that price to have those  bad maps views   na i dont think is that great to deserve the money but whateverthis dude has  watches on what the fucklove your content but please slow your delivery pace its frenetic and makes you feel anxious listening to youi must admit that you are saying little bit to fast sometimes as for non english speaker some words are melting into whole sentence so i sometimes dont know what is your intention to sayhow dare you talk bad about sonywhere  daf is the nacho dispenser you chrashed my heart you dc are a lierthis comment is ironical just for explain to all that peoplesolar panel is a joke in this watch at this price garmin can at least fit a bigger panelwow slow down following your speed talk is very unpleasanttoo bad these things are still enormousflag ship products should not be subject to notgetting new software and updated software features when a new model comes outfor example i bought the fenix  sapphire hr when it came out  paid over aus  and only  years later i dont get the new software features thefenix  and  get  this is greedy  i will never buy another flagship model again until you make apolicy change for flag ship top dollar products why get crystal sapphire modelwhen the thing is out of date after  months   ill get a cheapmodel and update it every second year who cares if it gets scratched it will be out of update service in  months anyway very bad businessdecision imhothanks to ad blocker for the free review  i dont contribute to anyones ad revenueim really enjoying your content as a new sub but seriously slow down you speak so damn fast i have to pause so many times and try to decipher what youre saying its just frustrating if people cant take enough time to watch that you have to speak that fast they have a problem just slow down and let the good quality information be freely available my opinion but i doubt im the only onenothing important and professional presentationlet me keep it real the navigation graphics are trash you get better pixels playing pac man  than what was presented in this video nuff said stan lee r i pjust bought it and dissapointed the watch looks cheap compared to suunto and basically at  pounds is a rip off and you can get watches for half this price which can do what you want them tooits a gimmick really with all the widgets which most you would never use and you can get the free apps on your phonenavigation is a let down with basic mapping i would expect  is mapping for this price again view ranger on your phone is  a year and very goodsorry garmin bring your prices downlast time i checked base  still have a gpslove your reviews but please try to sneak a little slower for better understandingyou talk too fastapple watch series  and the new series  are much better than this onenext video talk slower pleasetoo much noise for nothing still the same problematic hardware with a few software add inssorry didnt finish the video so many words compressed in  minutes without breathing i just couldnt seehear the other  minuteshard to watch the video the dude is never breathingyou talk too fast mangarmin products are just overpriced way too much money for a stand alone gps and their watches most people dont use all those features and ive spoken to a few that dont even know half of what the watch does it looks nice  is a lot for something that looks nice yet drops fast in valuei still cant believe i paid  bucks for a watch with such an awful screen its ridiculous in  the screen looks like we are in year i had to slow the speed down on this video to  he talks so fast is was messing with my brain  take a break and breatheman the ui is ugly thobye bye apple watchtoo much talkingi am kinda disappointed with the route garmin took with fenix  series and here is why no lte version no adaptive training guidance  it does not appear that solar version can charge up itself from  batteryadaptive training guidance is something that is available through firstbeat and sunnto already made a use of it in their sunnto  or  models i dont see this in fenix  series the only thing that they added is body battery feature which is nice since it includes hrv however body battery function does not give you guidance as to adapt your current training plan nor does it give you a live feedback how much you should push yourself in each activity i think this is a huge miss for garmin i think both polar and sunnto are moving in direction of not only data gathering but also data analysis and adaptive guidance to help you improve garmin devices are good at gathering all sorts of data but you almost need a phd in exercise science to interpret it garmin should spend more money on developing algorithms to help better use of data that garmin devices collect garmin coach is barely adaptive enough as far as i know it does not take into account hrv to tell you when to train and how much to train i think i will stick to my garmin fx and add whoop biceps band to help me get a better edge on my recovery and training guidancefirstslow down dude you are talking too fast like you are sports broadcasting a boxing matchtotally useless solar panelsdude could you slowdown about    not being able to keep up with what you are saying is a major turn off and results in me and others bailing on your video this is a review  not a race u should slow down on your speechppl are feeling u are nervous and cant hear it that clearbunch of garbage go to the forums first to learn about charging issues having to replace the motherboard etc and the ergonomics are absolutely atrocious you cant read the watch its got such a dark display going back to samsungyou talk faster than i can listenit will not be as popular as iwatch or galaxy watchthese watches are ridiculously overpricedi didnt find the strip club neari would suggest ab work for you otherwise you r in great shapebeing that nasally you need to slow down your talking speedopen your mouth a little wider when you talku talk to quick is it possible to speak faster jesus breathe man your stress must be highi recommend you to speak slowlier so we can enjoy

adding features thanks guysgreat job that was very informativegreat overvieuw guys tnx a lotgreat job both of you hello gentlemen as usual a very well done and helpful video a recommendation for future end of year eof reviews would be to add some comparison charts for us data geeks for example it would be huge to see a chart of battery life comparisons across all the devices maybe with a standard settings like gps use during activities pulse ox during sleep only like watch faces etc thank you very much for all the diligent and hopefully fun work on both of your vlogsthank you so much guys for putting this together i picked up running again over two years ago and currently using an apple watch  but in the market for a fitness first device to bring up my training to another level im a data guy and never realize how much im missing out using an apple watch though i will miss the apple ecosystem and smart watch features lots of options out there and im leaning towards coros apex or apex pro but i keep finding myself looking at options thanks to all your reviews and recommendations keep up the great work much appreciatedwow what a great video  its sad to realize that i have to wait another year to watch the next episode of this seriesyou guys having a hearty chuckle and dcs golf jab is the most wholesome thing ive ever seenthanks for the extended break down guysawesome video i love my garmin fenix x sapphireso awesome to see dcrainmakerabsutely love my coros pace  for the money there is no other multisport watch that gets close to it accuracy is great usability great as a lefty the crown dial actually works pretty wellnice thorough review of watches i know that you test every fitnessrunning watch available but when you arent testing something what is the fitness watch you personally usegreat job boysgreat overviewlove this cross over even more than the avengersgreat review fellas i just ordered the garmin forerunner  the red onethis is in my mind the keynote of the smartwatch world  this is how i get a good feel for the field before i recommend watches to peoplei praise you for a lot of information and short timegreat review good to see both of you it would be good if you announced a winner or top fantastic collaboration was great viewing  hopefully a good experience for you guys so do you flip to do the editing  during  i switched from trail running  ultras to golf  yes raygolf here in south africa johannesburg its been easy and safer to gather on a golf course garmin vivoactive  still works for me as it combines enough running  golf features only  golf courses at a time  which need to be downloaded thanksill be productive today aaaand there goes  hour of my day p thanks guysmy two faves on one video i gave you guys a thumbs up spiritually two for such a great job getting all this information out there however at the end of the day when the dust settles the garmin fenix  pro is still the standard by which all others set their watches by pun intended even though its technically a  watch it still has features that would make mr universe cry if ever hed tried to challenge all the programmable exercises fenix  pro has to offergreat job deshey guys incredible vid thanks so much which watch has the best most precise gps accuracy for mtbyup watched the whole video finalised on the garmin  fenix   pro sapphiregreat collaboration if only include a review of the casio pro trek wsdfhrgreat stuff guys any reason for me to upgrade my fenix hr titanium thats still working like new what am i missing out on  i bought an instinct for a present last year and almost kept it after playing around with it no vo max was deal breaker for methe coros pace  shows that the price of these devices which is skyrocketing in the last few years derives from market strategies and it has little to do with the cost of the research and the technology behind thempolar vantage v now on sale or coros pace  as an advanced running training gps thankshad a casio gshock watch for about  years looks similar to the watch in the show  as do all gshocks m water resistant solar power charges a capacitor not a battery  had to have mine changed recently also satellite set time its great but its not smart i need to monitor heart rate following massive familial hyper cholesterol based heart attack in april want to get back on bike running swimming with a bit of gym most important is controlling immediate transition from main effort to extended cool down for steady heart rate reduction to rest looking forward to their recommendations within my budgetany chance you guys would be doing the garmin descent mkwow cant believe its been a year since yere first sports watch reviewmy only question is how long did it take to download rays raw footage for this   great job guys i like that the esports instinct got its hot moment in this video i have big hopes for  devices from garminjust a beginner in the watch game here  i came back to apple last year with the iphone se for  just got a series  for  so cool that i could get a new phone and watch for less than the price of the cheapest iphone  great setup for someone whos a beginnercasual like mewhat watch or watches would you suggest for me i use an iphone im a trail hiker road cyclist and occasional runner and referee but also train indoors circuit  weight training treadmill runs indoor bike training zwift on a wahoo kickr snap and i have a wahoo element with tickr hrappreciate the helpful  and insightful reviews  btw what apps do you use to shoot and edit the split screen call very clean and well done as well  one question can you make customized running routines with the casio move appasking because i wish to upgrade from my garmin  soon and yes money is an issue and also im a casual runner but i really like and its super useful making customized runs in the garmin connectreally enjoyed that collaboration thanks both of you this is essentially what happens when garmin looks  a pile of left over instincts  ha btw roots hoodie  i am watching this with my beloved fenix  great review and i enjoyed it a lot i wish i can buy fenix pro what is the best gps watch for marathons onlygood video  thanks garmin vovoactive  wasnt reviewed thoughts compared not fenix  pro im tossing up which way to goany luck with review of hawaii  gt pro reviewi need both fitness and smart watch i have days where the smart watch is more essential than a fitness watch  im still reviewing garmin watches so many varieties and they put some important features in a pricy low end and other important ones in higher end versionsi have a question for both of you if you could choose just one watch that you would wear all year in  which ones would you choose and why i know that it is a very personal decision but i would love to know if you guys were in the middle of an earthquake which watch would to reach out for and whyvery very very amazing review but which  do i get lol i love basketball and music and dont want it to break or have band issues touch screen is actually preferred for me but functionality is a must idk garmin might be a clear favorite for just featurestalk about analysis paralysis inducing my dream fitness tracker would have garmins firstbeat software sleep tracking accuracy of fitbit heart rate accuracy of polar o or within  pulse oximeter accuracy of apple watch  and slimlightweight design of garmins vivosport hey des great video i just made me subscribe quick q if you got a second i have a galaxy watch act  but iam underwhelmed with the fitness and samsung health app would you recommendthe garmin sq music or the fitbit  versa  sense for around the  mark thanksfantastic video guys where is forerunner great video what has the best hrm i find my denix  for anything nut running is pretty much useless i feel a bit of a weirdo wearing one at the gymthanks for the review whats the best sports watch for broadcasting wrist based hr in terms of accuracyi have a vantage m which i find accurate compared to my chest strap but unbelievably the polar vantage m doesnt broadcast hrwow so many watches to choose from  can you tell me which watch has the most accurate hr sensor for an android usereverything you looking for its herethinking of switching from my polar ignite great watch to a grit x no more updates or vantage v but maybe there will be an ignite  cause now there is a zwift partnershipi work on a ship and am looking for a solid watch for compass and gps on and need to keep good time very importantthank you for the great and hard work testing for us but what is the name of the software you are using to compare the gps and heart rate when are testingdesfiti have fitbit sense and i use it more for sleep recording statusis it any other better health watch with better sleep recording functionsstill waiting on that ticwatch reviewi love the garmin watches i have had va and fr but the vibration is too weak to wake me up  is there a garmin out there that has a strong vibration alarmplease recommend the best triathlon watchkindly suggest which smart watch should i go for as i am fitness athlete and workout i do is crossfit and strength trainingcouple of quick questions for you if you could only wear one watch which one would you pickim still deciding between garmin  and apple watch series  i know that the apple watch has a more accurate heart rate sensor but i actually like everything better on the garman watch for my needs do you think the garman heart rate sensor is accurate enough for zone cardio trainingwow very nice video but in your opinion what is the best solution currently available on the market for those who train at an advanced level in crossfit but cant stand the heart rate monitor and dont want to give up the advanced smart functions currently developed  i was thinking of apple watch  with third party apps for training but what similar android solution would there be  with garmin in my opinion many smart features are lost and samsung hr monitor is really not very reliablegreat looking well produced video it would be helpful to start the video with a summary and highlight some of the best watches at the start so viewers can jump to those specific sections instead of having to watch the entire houri am surprised that you did not include huawei gt  pro in your line up of smartwatches for reviewso did you guys confuse the polar unite with the ignite the polar website has the unite for  and the ignite for  anyway i grabbed a unite and love it since i never ride without my phone for safety anyway so i use phone gps love the watchs value and comforti had a garmin vivoactive  which took a looooong time to connect gps and is not accurate in getting swimming distances correct so im considering to get another however with the rest of my stuff hrm cycling headunit all being garmin garmin is still in my alley of consideration so as to make it an ecosystem of its own im training triathlons with a coach from overseas and i get my training programs from him through trainingpeaks so i will need to upload my data for him to analyse with all that what is best option out there now  garmin  a little too exp coros pace  not sure whether it is compatible and metrics it provides polar vantage m  what would you guys recommend any day now when is  dc rainmaker and desfit video coming i was going for the v but saw some reviews and they mostly said the heart rare was very missleding is it worth buyingso for someone who just started running not looking to do marathons or triathlons what is the best band for the buck to keep track of heart rate distance and gps im town between polar and garmin watchesi want a nice trendy watch which one should i buyneed to buy which watch now ahhh the  big hitters of youtubedid casio make the shortlist what it was on  on the fenix  when dcrainmaker pressed a button look like animated activity selectorplease do a review on gshock asics collabs and the runmetrix app much appreciated love from malaysiahey des what do u suggest for fitness smartwatch among apple se and garmin venu sqgood stuff guys wouldve liked seeing an amazfit device or two included in this shootout cheersquestion is it still worth buying fenix  considering the price is very low nowdo you think the fr would be more appealing at even  vs  as that would put it at a midway point between the frm and the fr  i feel that at  for the fr that in a sense makes the m overpriced when you factor in the multisport modes and more advanced training and recovery metrics and the ability to pair a power meter to the  with the ability to perform guided ftp tests for cyclists and conduct guided lactate threshold tests for runninghi im looking for a new sportwatch i have now a fenix and im looking towards the forerunner  and the polar vantage v i do a bit of cycling  but my main activity is running especially from k to half marathons and next year my first full marathon i train alot on a track and i know that fr has a specific option for the track has the vantage this option as well i read a lot that fr has the option mapping and offfline music storage but i have always my phone with me for ice situations i want the best watch for training and the best data overview can you please help me decide thanksthe always on altimeter is for skydivers i remember them using them with there otherswill the fenix  work together with my polar h chest strap or should i just go with a polar watchthey had to charge all these watches before making this video imagine that power baryoure my new favorite team replacing farleyspadejust curious why do you praise apple watch while talking down on galaxy watch  and active  is it the hrm thats so much better on aw because as far as i know after updates the gps is much better on gw than everything  before awwhich is the best value to money lte watch under  for android following massive heart attack in april i have a polar hr heart rate strap so i dont have to rely on heart rate monitoring on a watch but could have a watch display the hr data  if possible i can install my samsung j phone on my bike handlebars  it has gps of course and can display my polar hr data but its not water resistant so heart rate and gps would be useful but not essential for watch if watch can display the heart rate and phone data with the phone in a waterproof bag and not visible want to get back to riding running swimming any suggestions please budget preferably maximum of   the sense and versa  heart rate issues is driving me nuts its a perfect device for me but the heart rate issue is just so ridiculous and unacceptable for a watch that it supposed to be more of a fitness tracker than a smart watch i loved the fact that i could do voice text replies android but the heart rate inaccuracyyyy hello and which is the best garmin polar suunto etc  love your reviews which would you pick between coros pace  vs polar vantage m whyso you need not use the speciality clock face to read blood oxygen in the versa  wow all other sources told me otherwise  thanksalways wonder why polar dont give the option to store music on board for use with bluetooth buds would make me consider them as an option over garminso which watch has music good for running and biking and is budget friendlyyou forgot amazfit gts  oppo watch and probably xiaomi smart watch as well even though its more like a smart watchwhat happened with the review of the ticwatch pro  is not worth itwhat ends up as top major problem with fitbit is they are pushing their premium subscription service and are limiting what you can access from your device without that service  none starter for mei want a g shock that is a smartwatch with gps map and full os functionalitywhen you upload the review of ticwatch  pro i didnt buy it because i want your opinion same reason i havent buy huawei gt pro because is very popular watch i wonder why you didnt review it or the first one huawei gt mmwifi is also missing on the polar watches which sucksanyone knows in a few words how the coros appwebsite ecosystem is likehey i am looking for smartwatch with offline maps capabilities i dont want to keep my phone with myself do you have something to offerwhat is the watch your wearing desso what im seeing is that coros is the best out of the watches if not correct me pleasehi i brought the fitbit charge  and the gps is just not accurate out by  and this is a lot when you do a k or a cycle  can you check your stats again as just wrong  i have a case  open with fitbit for a month now and the only response is they know about it but no answerwhich one i the best one which smartwatch has the best sleep trackingdcrainmaker     golf what is that you are know my favorite reviewer  i hate golf  god made spearfishing kitesurfing  hunting rock  climbing so people wouldnt have to resort to golf pretty much the only thing i disagree with is the comment that people want an amoled display on the fenix series watches  because the fenix line is made for outdoor use readability is the most important thing  and by far the readability on the fenix watches is way better outdoors than amoled  the fenix market and that includes the  market want a sports watch first  the only thing required is text and phone alerts everything else can stay on the apple galaxy venue and suunto  watcheswhy no whoopi had a garmin fenix  and sold it for a polar vantage v when it came out why the gps chip in the fenix  is absurdly inaccurate skewing all the other running metrics to being just a vague guess really i would never have picked this up if it wasnt for the fact i run with my wife and the distances with her fenix  and my fenix  was almost  variation consistently anyway with the polar our runs are usually   meters which is fantastic just a heads up if you want a fenix  be aware its gps chip is not the same as the other modelsfitbit is not consumer friendly most of its features are locked behind payment or premium subscription imagine this you paid for the hardware  the whole watch but you cant access its full feature unless you pay

but the gummy bear container sold it to me might even get one for my wifehad to bring out the jacket for this one on pointwith gen two garmin fixed the only issue that gen one had  the brightness of the display outdoors there was no issue i must say the new display looks amazing and maybe by the time i need to upgrade my gen one itll be gen three  but happy with it every minute it is on  my wrist caulk it up to buying a tool that you use multiple times an hour every day of the year and the price per use is a bargainin the review the marq  is considered similar to epix  but actually it has a display of  which is smaller than the  of the epix  that is a big difference between the watchesit looks really really good by far the best looking sportswatch so farits a good morning when mr dc has a new videoawesome i only got on yt just now hoping you had received and reviewed one incredibly good looking watch all around it did look substantially thick though thanks for reviewlove it how you dressed up to be somewhat in style with the watchi literally laughed out loud when the camera switched and you were wearing the sport coat at your desk  im owning a marq commander gen  and im wearing it nonstop for three years now for me it is the best watch i ever had its also the smallest of the marq collection and the size fits best the other models are too chunky got it second hand for half the price tag and it is totally worth it there is a niche market for this definitely its for those people that like to spend much money on watches that like the functionality of a smartwatch but want to have it in best quality materials almost like an analog watch i think they dont care if it is outdatet in three years but within this time frame the quality of the watch material stays the same it got saphire glass and it still looks like brand new i would be more interested to see how the gen  marq commander looks like wouldnt be worth for me to change but i think for people interested might be interesting to wait for it since i think is the best model of the marq collection kinda understatement in appearancei evaluated all these new garmin watches and decided to buy the fenix x battery lasts over  days it also has the biggest display option available i like big watches i dont need amoled display that drains the battery i want my battery to last thats why fenix x is the perfect choice for meour ray dressed sharp for the occasion  legend di just got one for christmas and love itlove the addition of the sport coat excellent as always keep them coming looking sharp brother rayyoure the best as always love the coat very formal nice watch toothis watch looks amazing jeez those are beautiful watches  if my stock portfolio triples i might buy one  its fitting that you wore a sport coat for this reviewyour jacket is really nice ray being able to load in flights in advance to have it adjust your suggested workouts in advance would be a very helpfulwow they released this beast at lastgreat video thx for sharing i wonder if there are any hardware differences between the athlete and adventurer version or would it be possible to configure the athlete version just like the adventurer in terms of technical aspectsthank you for great honest review as always why not change the design for that price thinner for the examplegarmin has their entire launch strategy ass backwards this year they released more or less watches in order from basic  best using a  for the last few years i felt the itch to jump on the next highend multisport watch and ordered the epix g and i love it while they look wonderful there is nothing so compelling about the new marqs that will persuade me to pick one up now that ive made my triennial garmin investment release your flagship first and i likely spring for one to satisfy the itchi hope garmin wont keep focusing on the appearance other than firmware function and bug fixes from years of fenix users to epix the upgrade is significant and its making sense for better screen with higher resolution from epix to marq it misses the fundamental genie of garmin watch we want to use garmin when we are doing activities and we want to monitor it marq vs epix is like lexus vs toyota if i make enough money probably i would pay extra for the look however k invest on relatively short life span watch seems not a good investment to me i would spend that on bike hiking gear instead damn that price tag is insane my fenix  solar was not the cheapest back then but this marq athlete sets a new leveli was planning on getting the captain i wear an epix gen  all the time and switch to a nicer watch from time to time it seemed nice to have an epix that i would switch lessbut hearing that the software updates stop y later is too short so just going to keep switching out when i want and keep mainly relying on my oura ringthanks for a great video they should have added a microphone and a speaker to make this the ultimate fitnesssmart watch and maybe justify the price a little moreive been  using the first generation marq athlete for a few years now i absolutely love this watch im tempted to get the generation  the carbon fibre editioni really like the way the strap is like the instinct strap now i find my fenix uncomfortable to wear as it moves around if its not ultra tight unlike my instinct  where the strap bends down on my wrist holding it betterthe jet lag function would be great in descent mki any news it comes therethanks for the video it looks good but ill keep my enduro  for fitness and longevity and the aw ultra for a smart watchhaha i am going to the merchandise shop right away will finish the video later hope your trip is good any idea if they will put out a  lte  you would think the apple ultra will push them tooi travel to countries with a time difference of  hours almost quarterly and as ive gotten older jetlag really bogs me down  im curious to know how well this jetlag advisor works and if garmin will implement it for the epix or fenix via an update  update  just watched your entire video and so happy to hear it may make it to the epixits the material that last forever i have a marc commander gen   and it works wellof course it comes out exactly  days after i receive my epix in the mail i was tired of waiting for the new marq and figured it wasnt coming anytime sooni was wondering when theyd finally release gen  it was crazy they were still selling gen at those prices with no touchscreen yes these are expensive theyre for a niche audiencewhy doesnt garmin store your info hrv in this case in the cloud so when you switch watches that data transfers to the new watch i thought they had something like this set up years ago for tracking steps for when you switch into james bond marq watch attire ill take  of each editionand a sport jacket as wellare the spring bars removable on these garmin switched to fixed spring bars on epix and fenix  hoping they kept removable bars on the marq series especially since these are more likely to be worn with premium dress bandsi am a sailor and the sailing app on the captain version seems great can i get the same sailing app on the epix series i cant find any info about thathi thanks for the video on the golf features seems like this watch has exactly the same features as the golfer version for the other versions are you effectively paying for the way it looks as in all marq  gen watches are exactly the same in terms of featuresapps on the watch thanksseems nice but i just bought the standard quatix  no amoled  because  i mount my watch on my kayak hard to see the info on the watch while flailing around with my arms problem with amoled is that you cant turn of the brightness dimming down no biggie when the watch sits on your arm but if its mounted to a bike or a kayak etc its more or less useless and unreadable during workout since its sleeping was a bit worried that the fancy amoled screens would make garmin trash the older mip type screen and went for the best mip watch i could afford amoled looks amazing though when the screen is oni own the epix gen  but love the look of the marq gen  that said i cant justify spending k on an upgraded smaller watch just for looks now if the marq was the size of the fenixx id have to reconsidergreat videolooks amazing but ive had nothing but problems with the heart sensorsdons sports jacket for this review hi dc rainmaker i was just wondering what is your every day go to garman watchthanksi have the v the best watch i ever had never regretted it wont plunge again for v and skip  or  versions but if you can afford it dont hesitate a secondjust a few weeks after the marq they launched the fenix  with a better display lets see if something similar happens again with the marqedit this time its the other way round i just saw in the specs that the marq has a lower display resolution than the epixby now i feel they shouldve made a fully wireless charging system like apple and samsung watches the metal contacts are the weakest points to these garmin watches also this one in particular is a little too small lolim pretty sure my  charges in about an hour too but it has nowhere near the capacity as the watches you mentioned that take  hours to chargeray first of thanks for the tweet reply over the overview request  secondly id reckon you had missed out one feature of the watch more on the software side the stock tracker i wonder  how does that worksin your test of the epix the battery lasted about  days with always on display has that changed after six months or are you using it differently nowgreat review can always on be set to automatically be enabled for workoutsdoes the garmin marq athlete gen  also has the small flashlight as the garmin fenix  what about the solar option thank youi like the charging porti bought the d mach all though im not a pilot bought because of the look version with titanium bracelet   and as far as i can see its all most similar to marq its cheaper if you buy it with a leather braceleta marq with titanium bracelet extra is most double up to the d m i can recommend the d m i use it only as a smartwatch and the health sectionfitness  bicycle works just fineif garmin offered me strait up msrp for epix to trade it in i might go for thiscan you use the rubber band from marq in a epic like the curved endso just look at the bottom of your screen youll know it but i wont know it lollike the sale pitch lol the suit thing is funny whacked the button this is really cool but way to expensive i find the epix  to expensive as well since i got my fenix  quite cheapyay another damn chargersure rock away and get three send one over to me too i would love a magnetic charger for the fenix these mechanical cables just suck over time they get more loose and you have to put the tweezers on them to bend the holding mechanism into place again just so s reminds me of times when you had to use folded paper to keep your cellphone battery in place just as an fyi dc rainmaker if youre reading the music overlay at the beginning was way too intrusive i ended up just skipping through till it endedstore your size comparison oreos inside the marqs boxgood day i need some help please can you show me how to navigte directly to a waypoint without using auto routing use to be easy but i cant get it working on my fenix x solar always want to auto route i want to use it while hiking or walking please pleasehate the thinner strap of the epix and marq  they should have the wider strap like on the fenix xhello i would like to know if the tacx neo t is compatible with the sram eagle v  cassettegreatis there flashlight integration like fenix xwhen will garmin  be releasedhi thanks for responding  i would very much like to hear what you got for me regarding marq vs d m but your mail is not validim not in the market for one but im a watch guy  grade  titanium makes a huuuge difference in durability better hardness than steel  most watches are grade  which is softer than steel and gets scratched to helli just sold my epix for the ultra i really liked the watch but it is just to big i wish garmin would bring some sort of mm epixmarq i know the ultra is big aswell but i dont know why but it does not look as big as the epixlooks like no flash light like the phoenix seems dumb but since i got that feature i use it every single daythey got me with the epix i got swayed away by the aw ultra now garmin means business and my bank account is in panic to  days in always on mode and the garmin was the one who made a fun about apple watch ultra battery dlike the epix mm is too small for meneeds to be mm like my tactixthis watch is soooo great marq  vs enduro  which is better the specs are just breathtaking but the reason i bought my fenix  saphire solar was the battery life i need those  days of run time because i dont want to charge my watch every weekwhy the screen size smaller than the epix with that price difference nothing beats the forerunner fenix  here since  you sure i wont pass it to my next generation i think it ist not so dark the screen like the other one sports watch from garmin oled are the garmin mki and the marq gen  comparable i know that the mki is also a dive computer but i was wondering whether they are equal regarding multisport functions thanks in advanceplease tell me which modeles in the range give the largest stopwatch and time  length displays to be seen through swimming goggles thank youi am one of those that pays thousands for a watch but i have actually never bought a running watch and the price seems too steep for me with that said the most expensive one actually does look good from the photo shownshould have deployant clasp and ceramic case at that price point  i feel like this thing is worth  the moment you take it out of the packaging and probably  next yearmy only problem with garmins is their interface feels like i am using a texas instruments calculatorcan you review amazfit trex  please good toollol how many friggin watch models is garmin pumpin out on a daily basisaround  i owned the marq commander i loved it looked amazing but wouldnt buy another marq to pricey for what you can get from the fenix x sapphire solar which i own and love it more and personally love it more than apples ultrathat is a very handsome watch but yes in a few years it will be more or less worthless and i found the fenix  plenty expensive for my budget so i will have to pass on this beautyps i noticed that the  on the bezel has some discolouration or missing paint on the top of the second  so i would be pretty unhappy if i had just paid a ton of money for thatdoes it recognise the napsis there any improvement on the phone app or is it using the same appis the fenix  pro sapphire solar better does it have the same screen size as the epixplease chill on the bg music thanks for the video the music is mixed in at a too high volume for me and it takes away from the quality contentmarq should have been x size as fenix x definitely bigger than epix maybe with that fancy screen but with bigger battery and it should include led light as enduro  this version  looks like they are trying to steal your money without any real effort to make a great watch wait does that means the new functionality will support naps i mean even not in a jet lag many people may have multiple sleeps in one daydoing any events in denverwhen are you going to make a ew video of the new garmin nd marq adventurei want a pasta tshirt heres the thing that i noticed from your watches scuffing i looked at the epix and thought that for the duration that youve owned it its got an awful lot of scuffing it even looks like theres some already starting on the marq  am i correct or is it the lighting and theres some reflectionglare i look at both and think whats the point of the added dollars needed for the marq the only serious advantage is charging speed at the end of it a question that i have in regards to all of the marq line especially when comparing it against the epix is there anything thats improved upon with the marq is there any software differences even between the different marqs or is it primarily aestheticscan the batteries be replacedthe usbc is likely to become standard for a simple reason the eu has decided that all electronic equipment like phones cameras and eventually laptops sold in the eu needs to be able to be charged with a usbc cable starting  and smartsport watches are likely to have to follow suit and if the eu does that any company wanting to do business in the eu will likely have to do adapt to itcould someone tell me why garmin has an insane number of watch models all of them with plenty of open bugs i really dont understand their marketing strategy and i also dont understand people that are willing to pay  for a buggy watch with more or less  years of support super review like always but could you put a compressorlimiter  on your voiceover please you are distorting sadlyalready got apple watch ultra come on garmin how expensive can magnetic clip on be its on every apple watch  pixel watch and even suunto they just dont want to lose their fat margin on that because they dominated the fitness watch marketone step closer to a tactix amoledis there an option to leave the display always oncrazy watches costing as much as low end tri bikeso where is the flash light like on the phenix x reallyimagine if that yellow color was navy blue or green insteadthat box looks like a good place to store all the money you no longer have after buying this watchsooothis or d mach  for lookswhat processorso everyone wished a stylish garmin watch they take epix add  features changed watch case and added  on topif this is not good marketing i dont know what is iti use actual a garmin fenix titan solar just as info that i am not some kind of fan boydoes it even take usbci have a fenix x pro and dont really get what you get for the extra one pet peeve of the pill shaped pogo pin charging contacts they corrode over time and gives poor charging contacts why cant they adopt wireless chargingfyi i hear wahoo will be sending out a cease and desist letter to you for your tshirt on an unrelated note wheres your hub reviewyou mentioned in a video years ago why pay for fashion when buying technology that is obviously going to change and be updated its not as if this is jewelry that you saving for you kids if you really like the fashion then get this watch but if you are really more concerned about the tech analysis aspects of a hrm watch then save your money or spend it on third party such as training peaks or some of the newer apps actually strava is really one of the best and not expensivethat protrusion on the bottom doesnt dig into your skinhi guys does anyone have a blood pressure watchthat price but looks good with a dial facegreat watch  but why on earth one will need a watch to tell him how tired is he after long flight one has to remember two thousand dollars to some is like two dollars to othersmiami vice look suites youobviously is overpriced i recently had my ultra and im very happy with it no garmin anymorei like how garmin can only afford to bundle a usb c cable with a   watchwhile i can see myself dropping k on a watch i would not spend that much on a watch that is outdated next year thats the problem with this line of garmin devices who buys thosedoes anyone else get a darker color like a tan circle on the skin underneath the watch after wearing a few monthsone of the garmins is over i have a brand new gen  sitting in my closeti ended up buying the captain and its been my daily driver since hit me up if you want itfitbit sense  review spoiler heart rate sensor hasnt improvedi save every one of my good watch boxes  i love them stack them up and stare  but  for a epix  that box will not be added to my collectionk nah they can keep it im curious to see if this product line still exists  years laterim not buying a  watch that will be obsolete in two years and stop working after a few more years once the battery and electronics fail ill stick with my omega speedmaster on my wrist and my smartphone for all the other stuff this watch can do thanks for the reviewis the sensor still plasticwho knew an apple watch ultra would be good value all the same materials less than half the costwell i paid a grand for the fx solar so it is really not that much different here are plenty of people who would not spend a grand for any watch still doesnt have body temperature while  competitor got apple fitbiti dont really understand the need for my watch to advise me on jet lag or any other need such as how much sleep i have to catch up on i know when i travel how much the jet lag will be from the number of hours i go each way same thing with sleep if i dont get enough sleep i know that if i want to know how much i got i can look it up in the app the problem with sleep it doesnt help for your watch to tell you that you have to get so much sleep the next day to make it up sleep doesnt work that way you can think that i have to sleep nine hours tonight to make up for what i lost last night and then sleep nine hours but you cant so its a wastesome smartwatches get os updates for six yearsi surely cant be the only one who has been pronouncing this marqueue since gen  as for longevity would you pay to rent this watch until it becomes obsolete  year   the math is ridiculous something between  per dayi had the samsung galaxy  pro and switched to the marq  adv i simply love the garmin and am super happy with it however i dont like the case its an unnecessary waste of money which is dumped on the customershey does it make sense to buy a fenix  over f how better is the build quality i really hate that garmin locks some software features to the hardware i would love the aviation features but dont like the look and size of the dedicated watch theres no reason why these software features shouldnt be available on all there wearablesdont go halfway brotha t shirt and a sports  suit jacket is a fashion no nodoes dc rainmaker have a carbon budget seems like a lot of flyingliterally millions of mileslike all garmins it will be great for  months and then detonatenew edge series zero vfm for these watches  if you have money to waste donate them to dc rainmakersmart watch companies are losing the plot with pricing but have nothing on bike manufacturersits too bad the captain watch isnt also an air capable dive watch bucks theres a limit and it was just exceedednah ill stay with my fenix x im goodif the epix or this were mm i would probably get it  fenix x is itrich people rejoice ill sell my kidney todaythose big sports watches on a mtb turn your wrist into hamburger meatlooks like  of the cost has gone into packagingjesus christ this is nutsso expensive bro had to wear a jacketi wished garmin would give a bigger battery to the epix and i was waiting for them to do itafter the enduro came out with a bigger battery i got high hopes againnow seeing that they dont put a bigger battery in the marq series i think i can forget about it sadwebsite doesnt say but it looks like the bezel is dlc coated no joy in my book my fenix looks like crap after a year and a half i dont want a k watch looking like crap after that amount of time i really wish they offered this without any coatinggarmin should really learn from other companies you launch the more expensive models first there isnt much incentive for an epix user to upgrade to these looks notwithstandingnice watch but  aud very nice money to spent another desire object for rich people who really want to emphasize how much important sports is to them to throw money ati really like it but just  too expensive wer kauft eine  uhr fr  jahre nutzungif you want one of these watches wait the prices with drop a lot in a yearcan it send text messages and make phone calls no will keep my apple watch ultra thank youfor people with more money than the average joebasicallygarmin has got be kidding this watch series is a joke keep it up garminkind of funny how it has apple watch ultra battery life now that theyve added an amoled aod while being slower and less responsive at more than double the pricek an no  phone integration is weird to menice mention of the plastic waste packaging this is the sort of stuff that makes me laugh when people balk at the price of an apple watch clearly theyve never actually shopped for more than a walmart timex beforeive seen several of these garmin marq reviews and honestly cant understand the over emphasis on the pricein an age where ppl are spending k on pickup trucks they never towhaul or overland withk in the world of jewelry is not alotthe average high quality wristwatch is about kkaverage  so is the point of these garmin marq videos to remind ppl who are broke of the price or to highlight the features that make the device a worthwhile tool for the buyer its marketed for stop harping on the price still no txt response no added smart functions no bigger batterydue to us garmin website only  lcd epix  has athlete version could has some nylon band includedmagnetic plug is too premium whatx higher pricelol garmin is selling watches for k usd and magnetic charger is too premium like wtftrainer i hardly know hertoo bad that it hasnt amoled and solar that would make the price a little bit more understandabledid one garmin engineer wake up one day and say let see if their are any idiots that would pay  for a smart watch no offence meanwhile all the top kenyan runners are using a  dollar casioshort story  protrekgshock nothing elsenot keen at all on that music at the startsmaller screen absolutely a disposable money purchase my problem is smartwatch tech obviously advances leaving this eventually worst case scenario non functional for the price i wouldnt pay to play for the short term but hey  im not the demographicnot way would i pay that for a smart watch not a chanceweed is the best money can buythe price is ridiculousa charging cable with fast charge should not and will not be a premium feature once apple kills garmin market share because lets face it garmin had been slowing down on innovations lately then they will move it to all products the applewatch ultra is a far better experience but lacks the fitness functions and once that is fixed garmin will be in troubletoo expensive for a disposable productfor the price not worth it  i get the early adoption price curve thing but you are paying x for  moreapple fan are so silenceapple watch ultra kicks this watch in the strap this is just unacceptable hr performance for a k watch much better to buy a cheaper watch with a strap thencareful wahoo might sue you for that tshirt design im aware how poor this joke iswhy is no one comparing the apple watch ultra you clownsill spend thousands of dollars on a good watch but it wont be a sports watchactually it doesnt look as good as the new tactix the more expensive the watch gets the more  ugly the watch looks  the cheaper version are more my tast  i stay with my fenix   epix gen  would be a nice upgrade this isntnopetoo expensiveon for a select

but the price is cheaper if you want only to do a daily exerciseso damn overpricedlol twice as expensive as apple watch ultra nah thank youi hate watches which need a smartphone to work properly just stupidbattery is the single most important thing in an exercise watch no thanksgarmin are a joke when it comes to charging cablesnext time garmin must give to youtubers watches in a cheap plastic and

isnt great maybe you should think of ditching music in the backgroundhi does the garmin  record both youre run and heartrate to the strava appslim chance but any chance you may know used to have it so my watch would buzz off every km but show me my pace in miles changed it for one session and now i only get milesmiles or kmkm no hybrid do you know how i can have my watch go off every km again but show mile pacecant replace the battery on this watch i got three years out of it but they are asking for  dollars for a battery replacement when i calledmy garmin forerunner  not showing call and sms notification what should i do please help meplease volume down your music if i connect this to a strava does it show my run on a mapi like the watch but find that i have a very difficult time getting it to read my heart rate accurately especially during runningnice video except for the annoying background music  it was kinda painful to sit through trying to block out the bad soundtrack   so do you have to connect it to your phone just to use itcostco has the best price on these  just got minei would of enjoyed video more if you didnt have that annoying sound as the background   could not finished watching videowould have watched but that annoying background music  i turned off the clicking music was absolutely thumbs downjuly  update a great choice today in  if you are in the market for a new watch is the garmin  non touch at  httpswwwgarmincomititpundefined  or garmin  touch okim somehow a wee bit late here  but thanks for the shoutouti love it as i would only get a watch with full on maps programme my trainings battery life training load body battery and the small weight but yes watch faces are unspectacular  great review  cheersjust got a brand new  from prime day for  im deciding between it and the instinct solar which i got for cheap as well since as someone who doesnt train seriously but still bikes a ton im not sure ill make use of all the s featuresanother awesome high quality video patricktotally agree on the analysis i absolutely love my im with you on waking up with sunrise my solution has been to use an amazon alexa routine to control a smart light bulb you can offset it by an hour either way and have it tell you the weather too even stagger a series of routines for different timeshey patrick thanks for your great review ive got fr  havent upgraded to  as i still love  and its like hard to say goodbye to it  i noticed and im thinking if to go for a brand new epix  but its hugely expensive i dont need maps navigation im runner need it primarily for running up to marathon and for all day long wearing even for sleep tracking during night yes im pretty used to have  every night during sleep as you said so fantastic lightweight sport tester thats why i dont want to urge to bulkier epix that leightweight of  is awesome tailored for runners  now im more thinking if new fr or  plus or something like that might come out soon i mean eg by mayjune this year then id like to wait otherwise dilemma if to go for fr or epix  but  a bit more likewise  best peter from slovakiagreat review patrick so much better than the rapid speak mainstream  reviewersi have forerunner im very satisfied ive tested a lot of these watches and i have to agree  the  is still an excellent option  the new fenix  or epix might be worth considering and itll be very interesting to see what and when garmin update the  to the    great video as always i have a  too and i think its still worth it only if you can have it for a good pricei was lucky to buy it at  so no regrets lets see what the  will be likelove my  and got it at  usd no complaint at allgood day what do you recommend to consider for running classes garmin  or lte interested in battery performance better gps signal more metrics for runningwould you care sharing or doing a video on the settings you use to get the best battery lifeit certainly gives a lot of information i swear by polar beats it tells me how many calories of fat vs muscle i burn so i know exactly how to tailor my nutritioni have the  love it i have some screen issues so i need to upgrade would go for  although i hear rumours that  may be out q decisions decisionsok but my question is if the heart rate monitor is not accurate at all as you said then all the relevant metrics are also incorrect hrv bmp stamina heart zones effort how can you recommend it and say that the upgrade is worth because of the addition of health metrics if these are offjust got mine is there a way to see swim bike run total distance of the week on the watch facewith the  can you start alternate between music and workoutsmaps without having to end the workoutciao patrick i can get a brand new  for  should i go for it as a beginner or it is outdated thanksthe gps on the  can sometimes be inaccurate pisses me of sometimes im considering on buying one right now would you still recommend it or are there other alternatives todayi have been using my fenix  every day since  and is still worth it johny rambo is backgarmin  or  both are  i have put over  hours of training on my  the battery is  pretty bad now bought the for runner  three years ago about  now battery fully drained in matters of hours called the service center in taiwan they said cannot repair only replace is possible and the cost is  usd no others options so a  usd garmin watch can last only  yrs and garmin is ok with that and is asking you to pay  to continue to use that model really are we talking about responsible and fair business here quality product it really the way it should happen  year obsolescence cycle i was really a big fan of garmin but to pay that  amount to continue to use a  yr old watch is outrageousgarminforrunner garminforrunner garminhi do you think the  is still worth it in  great watch but cant measure hrv accuratelyactually garmin is struggling with hrv with all there new watchesdoes your tshirt say dmt complete information short video and links to more information man you really helped me out i watched tons of different videos to really understand the system of navigation in the garmin instinct but yours was perfect short efficient and straight to the point with the link of your source  you really deserve more followers and likes  thank you i didnt know you can change the gps settings on the fly  very cool  thanksshort and helpful video about such important info good jobgreat video i checked out the articlegood video straight to the pointthanks for the video and ill check out the article you posted as well incase it has an answer to my question we are doing a trek to everest base camp next year and the garmin instinct is on my list as a good option do you know if glonass of galileo or even the us gps would cover that areahey thanks just getting used on this watch for my runs im using normal gps and its tracking the route perfectly only issue is that before every run i have to calibrate both altimeter and barometer because if i click run it gets the gps but not the altimeter and barthis is realy great  helpfullthis is great now i know about these settings for the activity i didnt know i had any power to fine tune them sounds like ultratrac would be good if your boating or fishinghey chriss thks for the useful tutorials i want to know which brand and models preferably  years old ones of longlasting solar power watches you recommend for using in the middle of oceans or mountains in emergency situations without internet access and only a satellite connection or other map kinds which suits better in ruff conditions it should work independently of mobile phones i had casio h which i wasnt so proud of another question is should we pay for downloading or updating any kind of garmin maps for smart watches thanks in advance dudegreat video go hunter  you belong in the top good video thanks thanks for the video not so obvious where gps settings are located on instinct  they at the same menucan you pull your grid coordinates from this watchif you switch offf gps but then go into open water swim mode does it switch itself on again for that activitythank youthanksi know im kind of late to the party but i wanted to ask is it possible to record the track you were going im planning on using this watch for mountainbiking and since i know the trail i want to shred i only want to record where i go is this possible with the instincthi this was useful i have a question however on my old forerunner a run uploaded to strava via garmin connect would show a route map in both apps somehow i dont get that with my instinct solar is this not a feature or am i simply not using the right settingcheersjust new to instinct all i wanna do is learn how to start tracking an activity for distance time and maybe pace  some of these videos do not reflect what my watch shows when pressing a particular button i know it has to be a simple setup to start recording a run for exampleultratrac might be helpful when you are on a week long or longer hike in a place with no electricity for example in the himalayan interiors obviously not on a trail race where accuracy is most criticali still cant find how how to choose gps options in garmin instinct tacticalthanks for the video loved it i am a hiker what would you recommed for gps in south east asiamy question while run start and finish which bottom used for checking how many kilometer run i hike a lot i live in lower north america what would you recommend thanks is it possible to display the coordinates of our position with utm projection how does it worksdoes it need any internet connection to operate the gpsi noticed you had the d distance and d speed settings to off have you noticed any change in accuracy if you have those settings on or offhow about if i just turn it off  will it still count my steps etchow do you get grid coordinatesthe forerunner  has both galileo and glonass optionsis there an  ar mode or adventure race modedoes the gps function can display z elevationaltitude on the screen howis the gps setting is pqswhat is the best option for ukim trying to figure out what setting to use on my watch  my last  runs all the same route have been   and today   ive been told that using glonass makes your watch stupid  there is zero chance ive been getting over  feet elevation but yet my watch says   and  for  consecutive days why is it so offhi please where can i find such or similar watch belt and how much does it costwill this work outside north america  thxim in the military and need my watch to have a good charge for days but i want to know how far ive gone i dont care about the route ive taken and dont care if the distance is exactly what i went i just want to have a good idea of how far ive gone is using no gps going to do that for me thank you in advancehow did you get your watch to say  d next to the batterymy battery is half dead and i just got it a day ago is this normal from set up anyways  i think im gonna return ithaving my email sent to a publicly visible or audio message is a nogo how to change it back i want silence out of my devicethis watch is  years old is it still worth it or is there better options within the pricerange nowthanksfor militaryhow to get a damaged screen protector offplease help me i have problem on connecting my watch to gps even though i have connected my watch to garmin connect  does anyone know how to solve itdo we pay for the gps thingcan anyone explain why any of these gps features are useful unless you running or just want to see how far youve travelled i cant see the point can you use them on hikes as a guide or are they just tracking devices galileo all the goso is it traceablewhat about asia im slow show me   which button you are pressing this is pretty wrong the ultratac is not less accurate its just updated less often after a k run ultratac will still say k but the route itself would have been updated less frequently if there arent lots and lots of curves theres virtually no differenceway this adventure watches not have emergency callis ridiculous the forunner  and  have thisi want my watch to read  km at the end of  km racesheesh so demanding not like you wont know where the finish line is the race start finish is the marker but the time in your watch is the metric you wantim lost already buttons too complicatedthese watches are way too confusing to usedude you spoke waaayyyy tooo fast theres no reason to chew threw the material that quickly esp for novices less caffeineultratrac is horriblehey folks  thanks for watching dont forget the full written review for even more details including accuracy and tech deep dives httpsdcraininstinctsolarman i dont need this but i want this its neathats off to you i was on the garmin site looking at these watches trying to decide what features are whatand you killed it hands down best description ive found so far i think garmin owes ya a little kick back you had better info than the manufacturer itself thank youi am a convert from fitbit just bought the garmin solar instinct omg if only i had known how great the garmin is thank you for being interesting and right to the pointa manual youre never going to read maybe im an odd man out but with something like this thats the first thing i do then go through it practicing the various functions from the manualmy first experience with garmin was with the foretrex  which ive used for a few years now in the military and when hiking i loved it so got the original instinct i almost upgraded to the tactical but held off and im glad i did because i was able to get the solar tactical fantastic most people dont need the tactical so save your money most honestly dont need the solar either but it is a great featurethis is the first review of yours ive watched and im glad i did very informative i really appreciate the detail you put into thisfitbit ionic literally just broke tonight been riding so much more and this showed up answering everything i wanted to know thanksthese new color options like  tidal blue and camo patters are awesome but that price of  is kind of brutal  i know it has more features but  is very hard for me to swallow   i am happy picked  up my regular instinct a couple months ago for    i am very happy with my instinct for all of my usesi like it battery life is my deal breaker when considering smart watches and having the solar and options to get weeks of use is fantastic i already see too many people not wearing their watches due to ohit ran it out i have a trisensor solar casio that has been my goto for any adventure as i know i can rely on ityet i think i need a bigger screen and a few more options which these offer while not bloating it with music players and all those other dumb things your review was greatnot sure why anyone would dislike a decent review that covered just about everythingwell done and much appreciated great concise informative video healthy sense of humor adds to the appeal thanksgreat review thanks i got the instinct nonsolar literally  weeks before the solar version announcement a bit of a bummer no trying to decide whether or not to return and upgrade add insult to injury lost my receipt which means i take a bit of a hit on the return price yet im still considering itvery well done sir  to the point information we want to know without wasting any time  earned my subscription and this is the first video of yours i have seenthank you for the contentgreat review tossing up between this and the basic instinct and youve sold me on this oneits a detailed and crisp review it covered all my queries and perceptions thank you for your worklost my fenix x by jumping off a cliff yesterday never make my mistakes and do not buy cheap wrist bands  it might cost you your watch fenix  looks great but id hate forking out  dollars just to find out a few months later that there is fenix  which could be a game changer considering to get solar instinct as soon as i stop mourning about my loss great video btw keep up the good worka year later the original instinct solar is still relevant and a very good addition to your health toolbox  not to mention its dirt cheap compared to the instinct  solarthe man just answered all my questions about this watch good jobthanks so much informative and interesting video much appreciate you taking the time i have the original instinct and love the rugged form factor and the light weightwhat a great video answered many questions quickly with chapters in the video thank youanswered my questions regarding the differences between the fenix line and instinct line thank youfinally a watch with the battery life i want i been using an amazfit bip for what seems like forevergreat video as usual all the key info i needed thanks from london englanddude every video you do is just so good thanks mani really wanted one of these until you told me id be responsible for my own death    the dying isnt a huge issue but as a millennial the responsibility part is a dealbreakermy wife bought me the solar surf edition of this watch i used the snowboard app last week and loved iti bought a instinct tactical after watching your video and its been absolutely amazingi recently learned to surf a few months ago and definitely want these added features along with no longer needing to charge itthank you for making this video it was very informativeas always great review  thanks hi great reviewi wanted to ask you if the vmax function for running is present in the solar devicethank you this was a great review very helpful i appreciate your efficiency shirt and sweet searchable  skipablei have been following your dc rainmaker site for years great review as always i have a random question what is the watch you are wearing on your wrist in this video do you have a review of that also it looks goodvery nice review there is a bunch of info that i did not know i was looking forkudos  straight to the point and no bullshit good jobi picked up the instinct tactical non solar a few weeks great watch i wish it had high low tide featurethanks for going in depth about the updated features i just couldnt make sense as to why such a big price hikethanks men  it helped me with my doubtsfeel like they are going after some of the gshock crowd gshock has much deeper experience with solar and bt  in fact just released the new glide with a really good watch display that does most of this except obviously not in the garmin ecosystem which so many of us have invested in thanks for the quick review well done as alwaysthe red light cool man heh great and informative thank youi just picked up an instinct for  a few weeks ago so i dont feel too bad about the upgrade if i were to buy one today i would still pick the instinct at a discount instead of the solar at full price it will be a while before the solar instinct is going on sales and i can live with charging it once a weekbrilliant watch the moss green i reviewed is the best colour in my opinion garmin have done a brilliant job with the solar instinctexcited for the forerunner solaras usual excellent video from the bestthank you much for your reviews pulling the trigger and changing from an apple watch something i havent been able to find though does it sync with apple health my coworkers and i like to compete and do workout challengesa garmin fenix lighti like watching your videos for it lets me know quickly how to use the garmin gadget i just purchased thank you for the details you always put into your smartwatch reviews and yes your chapter shortcuts were great great review im looking for a watch for road biking mountain biking and backpacking is this what you would recommend for these activitieswish they would bring that display and solar charging to their bike computersthanks great review will probably purchase this badboy a little correction however there is no such thing as a photovoltaic cell capturing  of incoming solar energy and converting that to battery charge especially not on a consumer gadgetthis is a great video ive been watching your reviews on many gps watches your video editing and commentary i enjoy the most well explained im on the market for a gps watch and am most likely going to get this watch however the garmin foretrex  is also on my radar though i know it is a very differen watch and market it would fit my needs i think can you please do a review on the garmin foretrex  that would be awesome thanks mate keep up the great work solid review my dudethanks for the review how accurate the altimeter isthats one good looking watchgreat video mate quick question is the fenix s solar worth the extra  over the instinct solarthanks for starting with the pricegreat review did the surf program come to the fenix line in the end and do you think it will be available on the new descent mkray thanks for another great video  you are the realdealthanks for the videothank you sirhey what an amazing and informative review on the new instinct solar please advise with the watch color name thanksoriginal instincts battery is already good but underwater hr is something id like like to have by the way i didnt expect the cameo to look that cool on the wristdang i just bought the older model a couple weeks ago still a great watch thoughgreat  best  informative loved iti just ordered this watch i think that will be my replacement for the samsung frontier hopefully im impressed with iti have a gshock mudmaster ive been waiting for a good solaratomicgps watch to come along for me to play with just trying to find one in stockhi thank for the good review  im passionate road cyclist and have forerunner  every time i go cycling for more then mls i start thinking weather i need the cable to recharge the battery  i noticed your  years le tour poster so i guess you know thats all i would consider ulgrade for the solar is enough to charge it rightfor a multiday ultra like marathon des sables using gps the review quotes  hours   hours  during something like mds you might get  hours of direct sunlight depending on how long you were on the course each day   do you think you could do a multiday ultra without having to charge the watch from a portable chargerthis seems like a good choice for mountaineering because of the abc features and long battery life especially at the price point would you recommend it for that or are there better choicesis the tide feature on the instinct solar surf edition something thats just in the watch or is it something that can be downloaded to the fenix x pro solarthank you sirmy  music gps died at some point started using a vivoactive  i had brand new in box battery life feels pretty meh cant use my running dynamics stuff anymore the instinct solar seems like it would be great for hiking backpacking and probably daily use for me would still missing running dynamics and vomax is there a buzzfeed quiz i can take to find the right garmin for medo these watches have a regular countdown timer though which you can set down to seconds accuracy i like sprinting intervall traningmy fr battery life is terrible as soon as i turn on gps  patiently waiting for fr to come outthis might be a dumb question but do the watch faces with a light or dark back ground use more powergonna buy soondoes this watch have a basemap i cant figure out if it has a basemap and thats the  feature i want in a smartwatchdoes the instinct have downloadable watch faces like other garmin sport watches forerunner   which i own or just the standard facealso just gray scale colors or multiple colors as wellhi from bulgaria here everybody likes dc rainmaker so far so good lets go back to instinct solar i liked it and went straight away to the local garmin dealer but i am kind old and became clear that digitsdisplay are designed for younger people ok but we dont give up fenix pro solar is the next option i do want a solar device i have my fenix for  years now and it is time to replace the solar option trills me for sure so i would like kindly to ask you for a review of fenix pro solar and comparison with instinct solar all the best and keep safeso my timex expedition has a countdown timer a countup timer and alarms does this watch have those capabilities thanks for any assistance jimhi dc rainmaker what would be the best buy for solar charging if wanted to rely only on solar charging between the instinct solar and the casio gdb h i heard people saying that the casio can run only from solar power thats what i want thanks for the timeuseful as always sir thank you just bought this one on sale as version  is now outlets see how i get onhithanks for the video a question can coordinates be entered on the watch to find points with the gpsdoes the instinct tactical have the extended battery as wellwould you take the instinct solar over the fenix  plus if used mostly for hiking running and everyday weargreat video thank you why not presenting the screen details with a screw driver thats coolcan the watch function during charging  i want to wear the watch during charging with a battery bank also any idea if i can get the info the solar capturing produces  many scenarios i would think increase battery damage creating small battery life reductionis the newer gps worth the upgrade over the regular instinct i just got the regular instinct on july th and wondering if i should return it for the solar the gps seems to fluctuate on the regular instinct at times when im not really changing elevations having accurate elevation is an important feature to me so want to know if its that much better thanks in advancenice clean video bro just missed does it have temperature sensor also vo max jump rope counter inbuilt i downloaded tht it from iq app to my fenix hr also if u could post size comparison pics of instinct vs fenix thanks brohi there love this review  i have the solar surf but the tide times are  one hour different to the actual tide times here on the isle of man  would you be able to help me to correct this issue pleasei cant wait for the new garmin instinct solar as far as i saw from the photos leaked on the internet the new garmin instinct  and s which will be shown at ces  will have a barometer moved to the very edge of the clock and also a new heart rate sensorthe camo looks sweetthe surf features are cool but dang can we get some support for our river sports id love some flow rate data or flood warnings for major rivers across country for those of us that live in a kayakcan you do comparisons on difference of the hr monitor on the solar and nonsolartrying to decide between the forerunner  or instinct solari like the durability and long batter of instinct but some other features on the  also appealing do you know if the instinct will ever get the emergency response applicationthoughts when comparing the thank you for the video do you know if it is compatible with garmin edge  i use when mtbthanks for the detailed indepth review how does this garmin instinct solar integrate with apple health and fitness apps pleasewow amazing i wish i had onei hope that the fenix  tactix delta has some sort of similar solar capability not sure how they are going to have to solar panel capability with the topo map screen though but it would be pretty coolyou had me at solargreat review going for the tacticalthanks for the review i assume that with the gps mode you dont need to have a phone paired to it ie when out surfing you will be able to see on a map where you paddled  surfed thanksdoes the compass still work in battery saver modeheythanks for the great review just cant decide on the color what would you pic for hiking mountainbiking jogging but also every day wearingtactical green or this dark greymaybe there are also people out there who have one of this colors and can tell which one looks better in real life since corona arrived its very hard to decide only online with the pictures thanks a lot in advance does garmin watches work together for example i want this watch for when im at work and out doors but when i have business meetings i want to switch to a more classy garmin while still having my fitness tracking im lineso with the new hr sensor would you use it for cycling  i wont wear chest straps and my original scosche rhythm is starting to be really sketchy with its ratings  thought about hunting down the new rhythm but i dont have a smartwatch and have some interest also could use for super long rides andor cx to ditch the head unit  fyi with my main bike i have a power meter so id need my head unit to see that data i totally understand that just looking to ditch the hr strap for this as a main purposedo you get a surf activity in all the instinct solar editions or only on the dedicated surf oneid be interested to know if a screen protector can be used on the instinct solar i have one on my instinct as damaged my previous insticts screennice review which would you deject between the instinct solar or the fenix  mainly used for hikingbackpackingive been eyeing the fenix  for a long time but the instinct solar seem awesomeanother great video thanks ive recently purchased the watch but am finding battery life worse than my original instinct i have checked battery capacity from   found it to be mah it also takes nearly  hours to charge  only taking  mah max i was wondering what your experience has been of battery life  how long your watch takes to charge so i can assess whether i have a defective battery thanksif you put a glass screen protector will it cause problems to the solar panelhi would you recommend it to me if i want a running cycling and gym watch if i only need the basic metrics very good review nice reviewi wish they would bring those power save mode options as a firmware update at least to the previous instinctdo any of the garmin watches work with strava or garmin edgegarmin radarwhich would you chooseapex progrit xinstinct solardoes it compatabil with the connect appthank youany chance to see advanced sport metrics in this otherwise amazing watch even the entry level forerunner  plus has more sport features its a shameive had a garmin instinct and was curious about the newer onebro am concerned about the colour of the watch what i see at  is the real color or not coz the one on website is totally different it shows light grey to black camo this one looks light blue to dark blue please help great video bro real smooth is the colour same as one on websitehi rayi wanted your opinion i dont like the garmin look very much but i have received a lot of interest with the surf app which shows the waves and tide i like the solar cells on the instinct are there any other watches that show these options and have strong batteries the fenix  is very expensive the pro is not so important to me because i have music on my headphones but the instinct solar is an unattractive watch for mebtw i have now polar vantage v ok but no wave tide and i stuck at some fitnesslevelthanks for feedbacki would love this watch if it had all the features of the forerunner  common garmin  you can dooooo itinstinct solar esports would be nice  how is the screen holding up does it scratch or screen protector is a musthey did the altimeterelevation get better than on the original version i read tons of complaints about this issue from the original instinct owners most of them say it is because of the place of the sensor it is just too close to ur skin as i the sensor is at the same exact placeso i would be interested if the new version handles the sweaty runs better and gives correct elevation thanksyou say its like the fenix lite but i feel the excellent battery life puts this in a category of its own for my purposes this makes the instict more like the fenix ultra thanks sirthankscant decide between this and the x saphire  when do you think the fenix  will launch many thnakshey ray did they move the location of the barometer hole to solve the clogging up problem of the original instinctthanks for the review three questions for you   does the non solar watch have more room on the screen since it does not have the solar ring around it  another review of the solar version said the backlight was washed out and not real effective compared to other watches again is that related to the solar screens does the non solar version have a better backlight  how much connected user interface exists between the instinct and iphonecan i set the backlight always on specially during night timedo these watches give speed in mph or knots i never see it in videoscan it read and display ant power meter for bikingforerunner  vs instinct solar what yall think i run and bike mostly and do bikepacking thanksmake a review on garmim tactix delta solar with ballistic pleaseray thanks for a great review i actually bought the solar but im still not ready to get rid of my regular nonsolar instinct comparing these two ive found that the nonsolar model has a slightly brighteror whiter screen with more contrast the solars screen seems to be not as clear and bright as in the old model besides the solar model is slightly taller the regular version two questions for you  do you know if the photovoltaic layer is placed under the actual screen with ink or is it placed at top of it just curious as this might have an impact on charging depending on the chosen watch face  sony gps chip covers only gps or glonass and galileo also  or these are all different chips thanks i got a galaxy watch  for christmas i really like it but i mainly use it for working out and hiking the battery life is completely trash even with every feature turned off you barely get  days and thats not using it lol how would this stand up with a watch like that does it track heartbeat steps sleep cycles weather can i hook it up to my earbuds how scratch resistant is the screen i wear my watch  and have a rough construction job i had to get all kinds of protective gear for my galaxy watch im wondering if it would be worth it to just break down and cough up the extra for the garmin tactix delta i realize sone of my questions are answered in the video im just typing my thoughts lolwhat is the green light that goes on the bottom of the watchhow is gps accuracy for open water swimmimgdoes anyone know if the abc sensors can be the only thing left on as part of battery manager so full smart watch mode but if i wanted i could just setup a battery mode which is just watch and abc sensor but everything else turned offis this the camo graphite version it looks kind of dark blue than graphite that i see on garmin web site and on line shops thnxwhat about course navigation as compared to other garmin watcheshi dc rainmaker congratulations for the channel for cycling which one do you recommend between this the fr the coros pace  and the vivoactiveits the pity they still havent changed where the altimeter is located on the watch my original one gives very inaccurate readings once my wrist gets sweatyheyinformative soif i have a full batterycharged from the mainsi think that gives you  days useso once the solar is charged to capacityfrom the sunwhere on the watchor garmin appdoes it show the synchronisation of these  charging options mainssun and give you a full estimate of the total battery life availablei understand the power saving modes increase the batterybut i cant really pinpoint this data of having the extended battery life available on the watchi hope that makes sensethanks jamesi just wish the colours matched the pictures on the site my tidal blue is nothing like the images on the garmin website complete different bluedo recommend the  polar v titanium or garmin felix would be nice if garmin would do the tide software to the fenix x plus as a update where i live we have the atlantic and the gulf of mexico would be extremely useful how about it garmin if yall are watchingcmon ray you know we always read the manual cool review mate i was wondering is the stealth mode really not just a fancy word for airplane mode and does the other instincts have this featureso the solar wont keep the watch from dying but just extend the time between chargesi want tide info but not enough to change to go for either color on those surf models im soooo confused as what color camo this watch is in your video it looks blue but what garmin offers is called a graphite camo and a green version what camo version is in your video thx and great videogarmin is finally catching up with coros battery wiseray the update to the fenix  solar series will have the fenix  coming out soon  with an amoled screen fingers crossedhi is it normal that when backlight is on there are stripes across the display seen is it normalnice video and good looking garmin question how do you compare the data itself you get from the garmin  compare with this new garmin instic solar hoi my vivosmart hr is kapot the strap gave out and i just got back into sports running again had some midlife issues and some time i rather forget and gained weight lockdowns didnt help either started a get of the coach program in november and i am gutted i cant use my wriststrap now not a newyears resolution plan is that after pools open again here in the nl  i will start weekly swimming with my diveteam again this involves touching the bottom at atm in due time i hope to loose some of my  kilos as well above all i want to get fit again so i am looking at a new tool i didnt like my strap for not looking like a watchit did its job though and i dont like some smartwatches for looking like a gimmick and daily charging but things changed since i last looked at them years againwhich one would you recommend the forerunner  in sale or this instinct solar feature wise music i lean towards forerunner however i do like gshocks with solar so with its tougher milspec and atm rating i would guess touching the bottom of the pool  daily life is better with the instinct how is its sleeptracking  how do they compare walking and runningi watched all vids and also your pal desfits on several watches and decided a sports orinted watch and turning of the message things from my phone would be better than a smart watch with sport options for me dont use this feature on my strap either so i guess it is better have more sport options than pings that distractlong story short i would appreciate advise from someone who has tried them allhi dc rainmaker did you have a chance to test it for a longer timeim asking as mine was showing really good battery life predictions  days plus with daily solar charging and on basic tracking mode with hr and steps and has recntly dropped to around  days for no reason was wondering if thats normal or a defectthanks alotis it possible to upload music on it and listen trough bluetoothi bought a fenix  with a similar display and basic open street maps capabilities navigation barometer thermometer accelerometer compass almost  years ago for i was waiting to hear how i could pop gps coordinates in and go geocaching drat im wondering if i should ditch my vivofit  and put a dinner plate on my arm i love most of the cool tech but still not sure about the size sigh   can i pair my wahoo tickr  hr chest monitor with the garmin instinct solar thanks for the videoanother excellent review as always  i know this vid is a year old but would you consider this watch an upgrade or a downgrade to the fenix  hr yes im still wearing one from  thankslol pointing with that screwdriver  best way to scratch the screenwas hoping for a bit more storage space the mb mb in reality is causing some issue with mine currentlyso i have the vivoactive  at the min and finding the battery is letting me down as i mtb and it only lasts  hrs or sowould this watch be a better replacement for apps and of course the battery will last way longer during tracking with gpsis garmin instinct is compatible with bike speed and cadance sensors i enjoy watching your videos i am thinking about buying an instinct solar or forerunner  music  i just started running k and k about  month ago and doing around  minutes for k i found that the gps watch can hep me improve my running please suggest i like longer battery on the instinct solar and better design and lighter on  music please let me know your thoughtsman i like the upgrades but i was hoping they would replace the instinct and keep the price the same or keep the old model at  and the new one at  maybe ill wait for a sale around black fridayevery time i watch your videos im baffled on why you dont have more subscribersmy instinct tactical heart rate sensor never worked properly in activity mode my heart has peaked above  the watch still in warm up modei realize they are very different devices  but does anyone have some thoughts on garmin watches vs apple watches  in daily use  currently i use my apple watch for day to day  and use a casio pathfinder for campinghikesbeachoutdoors in my mind a garmin now with solar would be a good combination of both hey  at night  can u see the displaydoes the night vision on the the tactical watch require night vision goggles or at night can it be viewed with the naked eyedoes this watch have a built in thermometeris there somewhere i can get a pdf of the owners manual that shows me step by step how to work the functions thank you captures  of the suns energy haha all energy of the suni know what you mean that it uses all sunlight energy absorbed its funny to point out how you said ithow do i add tennis that is not on activities listwhat is the difference between the red light and green on wrist with that circle on it or reminds me of g shock toonice videocan any of the menu scrollingsetting changing be managed through the appim very new to thiswill these download and display popular mountain bike trails and if so is it pretty accurateroughly what size are the time reading digits pleasemight want to use a plastic stylus to point things on the watch removes the possibilty of maring the item  even a wooden toothpiccan you use garmin pay using garmin instict solargood review and thank you for making my decision easier i would  pull the trigger on this because of the features especially the power saving customization but paying that kind of money for a basic  x  lcd display is just not worth it its literally a display technology from the s  no idea why they did thispicked up a new original instinct last weekstill wont go for the solar version for extra  dollars hmmm are the new charging pins stainless steel the gold pins on my fenix  sapphire are nearly worn out those news pins look a lot more durablepretty amazing video as usual just speak a little bit slower so i can get the most of it anyway keep moving buddy hey i have a question i cant get a gps signal no mater how hard i try its saying  gps signal is stronger outside away from tall buildings and trees so i was trying outside in  good spots in diffrent areas but the same message been using my garmin solar camo wacth for months now without gps i cant use escpetitions and other fuctions that needs gpsany help guysim still not sure if the solar is worth the price but it seems like they could have made an upgraded nonsolar instinct expedition model to have the power saver features and add in the expedition gps with less of a price jump than the solari am looking at both gbdh and garmin instinct solar difficult decision on this purchase anyway i am leaning toward gshock due to its appearancewhat watch are you wearingwhats the difference of instinct solar camo and instinct solar tacticalwhich model camo is this watch it looks like a blue ish water camo but cant find on garmins web sitehi barometer is okhow will you rate this with bravo  pilotis there a thermometer on this watchwish it had mp  playback and the tide  moon functionhey can the band be replacedi called garmin and they said mgrs is on all models the tactical one displays zulu time at the bottom which other models do not what does your experience show i just snagged the tactical for keep it upi find it interesting that in your video review and written review of the instinct solar that you twice fail to mention how much slower the watch charges than its predecessor  any reason for omitting this obvious facti have first instinct what changes in solar apart from solar powerhello nice videowill you recommend this only for running  it is certainly not the cheapest options but i like the idea of long battery with the help of solar techsince im so early just wondering if you think it is at all worth upgrading from the basic garmin instinctdoes this watch  on only display military timedoes this model come with running dynamic hi does it charge in sunlight even when the watch is switched offmy experience with the hrm is very different mine is not accurate at all dcrainmaker what is the reasonhi i got mine today i have only one question i fully charged the watch but it shows  days of battery life in the video your watch shows the same d why why not d as advertisedcan it be used as a heartrate monitor for zwift cheers from switzerlandgarmin fenix  with g shock design thats what i wantim windsurfing practican which garmin instinct support windsurfingwill the watch solar charge with its power off  how long to charge to half on a sunny daybeen using this for a month now and been out mountain biking but its heart beat reading when engaged with activity seems way off a lot of times ive tried tightening the strap around the wrist as well as wiping off the sensors but i have this problem every time i ride does anyone experience similar issueswill it automatically rely on solar if i put it on battery saver modemy tic watch pro  gps overheated after a light  minute surface swim in a pool  now im torn between getting vivoactive  instinct solar or galaxy  watch  i want to get something that will last  i had the tic watch for  months and now its toast and number  is jumpmaster where you can jump out of perfectly good airplanes if you choose to do that does anyone find the calories read as burned during exercise incorrect or offive had the garmin instinct for  days now and the calories seem to be reading pretty low compared to my previous apple watchim an experienced weight lifter  bodybuilder lbs around  bf when i trained today for  minutes my calories burned read  when on apple watch would read around  which seems more accurate hr was pretty consistent between  ive only used the strength training tracker so fari never entered any reps or anything done as i track that with my log booki just want something really to track my heart rate calories burned and timemaybe the apple watch could be wrong but when i inputted these stats into a calorie burned calculation given my stats it said my estimated calories burned were pretty bang on to the apple watchanyways ill leave this at thatjust wondering if anyone is experiencing anything similar or if theres certain settings i can adjust to get a more accurate reading ps i already have my stats entered into garmin connectthanksbest three channel talking about smartwatch in youtube is  dc rainmaker  desfit and oldbasgold the bad thing about garmin sleeping tracking why they still old school excellent review but good golly my friend you talk fastfenix  lite great deal i had big gps troubles with my instinct now i have fenix  and new chipset much much better and new optical sensor great too good update good device but why they do not put garmin pay its so handy greed garmin dc big thank you for your work did they fix the barometeraltimeterhave you noticed that when its measuring things  it vibrates very slightly on wristoutstanding video  im in canada and here the solar is literally double the price  vs   its killing me because i reallyw ant the solar due to the extra battery life and ive got a few solar gshocks but doublehard to swallowi wish garmin had just put the solar battery extension function in there for what it is  a means of getting more action between charges  and left it at that i dont care what my solar exposure rate is but that stupid graph takes up a pretty big chunk of real estate on the face   all i want to know is whether im going to need to charge my watch before i finish my next swim but thats garmins issue and not a reflection on this review the review is greatwill it pair with the hrmtridoes the solar have vo max thankshey man im confused between instinct solar and gshock g squadwhere is the barometer port located on this versionif you leave it in the sun how long will it take to charge or is it like fenix that dosent charge in the suni wonder how long it might take to charge the watch from zero to  using solar panel onlyis it ok to wash it thoroughy twice a day with soap due to this corona virus situation will the waterproofing take a hiti just got a instinct solar on sale for  i love it its awesome however doesnt anyone else think that  for a digital watch or worse  for a fenix pro is fucking crazy seriously i am not a poor person i make a good living the fact that the fenix pro solar costs almost as much a  set of carbon wheels for my bike is insanei wish there was a smart watch with just the features of calling and texting and no other widgets or a way to completely disable them to where you dont have to scroll through the othersgarmins are worth the moneyall the sensor readings are live and continuousno stupid delay like with some of the gshocksyou forgot the biggest reason for the tactical vs the regular you can manually inter gps coordinates and nav to themi like how they call it  photovoltaic when no pv materials currently on the market get more than about  efficiency i guess its just for relative comparison with the other section thats shaded by the displayso wait until black fridayhow does thr gps work so i do not get lost in the woodscan someone tell me if this has gps time synching ability  im very unfamiliar with garmin technology thanksgarmin need to chill on their paper manualsdo you need a monthly subscription for this watch does it have connectiq supportwow my brain got a software upgrade  i can now understand what he says to open the videowith the pulse ox blood oxygen saturation monitor its good to update original one doesnt have itdoes this have running dynamicsred light coolthis watch is now competing with the gshocks survival watches old and new rangeman beeing able to run of solar alone is a huge bonus in the survival category beeing a good gps and sports tracker us a good bonus compared to the gshocks oh and the price is much lower at the cost of sapphire and buildquality of the new rangemanno music hmmm i think i will just hang on to my fenix these are  at bass pro shop till christmas right nowwhats the difference between this and the regular garmin instinctso when are we going to get solar in the edge lineup of bike computers seriously my  has garbage battery life and its facing the sun all day when ridingdoes this tell you how many miles you have done does it give real time speedcan you compare this watch to amazfit t rexi am a garmin fan but at  that made in taiwan tag just kills everythingplease review samsung galaxy watch your mention of the instinct as a fenix lite makes me want to hear more from your perspective ignoring music maps and garmin pay for a second what are the main differences that matter for someone aspiring to become more fit what kind of training analysis or motivational features are missing on the instinct that you get in the fullblown fenix and does that matter more or less depending on what kind of sports you do eg running hiking cycling etc that would be a really interesting video keep it updurabilitythe tactical is by far the best but has  stupid yes stupid feature which is the jump master mode very few military personnel are jump qualified and even fewer are halo qualified with that said to meet mass military adoption across all branches i believe speaking with  years of military experience and  military job quals the tidewind data would best replace jump master understanding the idea behind the watch tidewind data could critical for casualty evacuation or escapingevading the enemyjust thoughtsdoes this model got music playback options  its a deal breaker for megarmin instinct solar over  rangeman casio g shock does this have solar charger  why do they call it solar  what about the garmin explorer external solar charger   there isnt enough square inches of solar panel to keep it charged i can see how it might just increase rangegarmin wastes the upper part of the solar screen where garmin is printed on for what reason just to move it to the circle in the upper right of the display to enlarge its displaywasting edging i dont get it they should take a forerunner  with its smart and thin plastic bezel and make the huge black design ring under the glass as a solar screen that would be an much more effective solar area complete it with a same energy saving display technology from the instinct and there you godoes anyone know if its water profthey dont have the blue camo on their website and i want thatsadthe main thing to know is that the gps wont work in a wooded or even semiwooded area so if you live or plan on hiking around trees forget about using the gps function my watch wont even update the time after daylight savings because i have a few redwood trees close by so much for being an extreme outdoor adventure watch unless you plan on hiking in the desert or on a treeless mountain top forget about trying to use the gpswhat happens when the battery doesnt hold anymoreis this compatible with iphonethank you for the review i just bought it  how can i see battery in  i just see daysare you selling the shark tshirt please take my money furtunately this video is workingit is the only thing of garmin that its opererating rigth nowcant believe they want to charge  extra for one extra software feature on the surf modelsstill no vomax can i record swimming with this onei have the instinct solar the battery life is the huge selling point for me used the fenix  sapphire and x solar if you dont need maps music etc get the instinct solar if you value battery life the best out there with all the feature offered the x solar fenix battery life with solar was little bit of a let down for me its the ultimate fitness tracker battery life on the instinct solar and for someone setting training goals the fenix  does give a lot more info on the home screen definitely worth considering as welldoes the garmin golf app work on this watchone thing i need to know is me watching you unbox it strangestrange how g shock has  full coverage solar and did so for years and years  i think there is a reason for the situationso the camo version is just a different color but for  more whati wish theyd make a gps watch that wasnt so smart basedso how is it that this thing has sup and row setting but cant even display knots which is the standard for speed over water great watch but thats a serious mistake from garmin being able to display knots is a very basic ability and it cripples this watch for sup sailing rowing and so onai want a smartwatch where i can use it as phone dont want to pay additional fees to carriers put the simcard that works independently from your phonetelling that the tactical aint the camo versionvo maxive had the older instinct tactical for a bit over six months the tactical wasnt worth the extra  because i dont have a starlight scope and if i were doing a halo jump id probably not use my watch to calculate itthe old one gives about  hours usage while navigating or recording in gps mode it can recharge at night it can recharge in about an hour using battery pack or wall plug can new one recharge by plug in or only solar if only solar its too limited to be called tacticalmine had been a great recorder of bicycle rides it uploads to strava and other apps and you can save the battery on your phonethe old one isnt big on the wrist which is nice if you want to wear it a lot to take advantage of fitness tracking i feel guilty when changing to mechanical watch for a while these dont have the feel of a real watch but the useability is greatps read the damn manual get the most out of your purchasewowow you mean no other watch before this one could give you pulse oxthe red  donethe only manual you will ever read is a gshock manual because if u dont u will be lost in the watchjust wish they would make the bloody screens bigger  becoming a old git eyes are getting worse for the detail seems the watches are getting bigger and the data you actually need gets smalleri really wished i like this however the only reason i will never get that is the ugly screen cmon this is the gbdh main competitor in terms of solar price and ruggedness  its way way uglier  the resolution and the shape of the screen its like i got it from a snacks pack cant even believe they didnt think a little bit more of how it looks insanely ungly to me  unfortunate cause for the price is really good but at this point for the same money id get the g shock for sure i wanted it for the garmin ecosystem and a menu im used to however this thing is going to be on my wrist and i have to watch it all day long no way on earth im using thisi dont think there is enough sun in a full year in wisconsin to charge this thingstill waiting for heartrate poweredif buyers knew the actual cost to manufacture these watches i wonder if the  of profit would turn customers off to buying onelooks like a gshockanyone use this watch for paragliding or any type of aviationmine is in the post wife got me a good discount yeah muthafuckerstheyre promoting these as us army standard ruggedness im in the kitchen quite a lot so will random bacon fat and frying oil spills make these toastgarmin need to up the design for this price point kinda look like generic gshocki just bought the original instinct for  i prefer gshock toughness  solar etcwhy suunto no have solar for their basic watch so sad suuntotrying to watch have to keep pausing it going to fastcasio rippointing with that file aka rat tail is making me cringe every time    love the watch thoughcapturing  of the suns energy absolute bargain for a small portable dyson spherereally wish these reviewers would stop saying  of the suns energysounds like bill gates wow now if you can just find a job that paysi wish these demos would go back to real basics kiss  keep it simple stupid  how does one navigate round all the multiple options easily you go through the power saver options as if we know exactly what all the navigation buttons on the side do you click those buttons as fast as you speak really frustratingi wander why did they made this great feature watch look cheap and plastic like those childrens eur watches in chinese store i wanted to buy it but eur for peace of plasticfor something that was built in china and sold for at least  over what it cost to build i say a big no thank youonly wacth poeple and human many bigguy slow down please shouldnt you do a real life testing on the actual solar benefits thatll bring to the overall battery life and not just rely on what was reported by garmin itself sorry imh poor review its more like a feature explanationgreat review but i would not buy this watch again  my wife gave me a garmin instinct solar for christmas  incl shipping and handling  today i noticed that crystal was cracked   due to the global covid pandemic the most extreme thing i had done while wearing this watch is take back to back naps  when i called garmin asking how could i get my watch repaired i was told that they dont repair their watches but that i was eligible for a replacement watchif i sent them   wait  what  yeah  im actually kinda happy this happened  i was just about to drop k on an inreach mini and a montana  series  now that i see that garmin doesnt stand behind their products and that they are not as rugged as they professim done with garminthis watch is crap dont buy it these positive reviews are paid for by garminslow down no buddy can fallow youit would be nice if we could actually see which buttons you are pushing you are impossible to follow in this vid  frustration at max levelsgarmin bracelets suck they tear so easily  must be the resin they use and please  slow down i had to turn playback speed down to  just to follow your speaking and its still too fast it just gets too garbled if i slow it moreare you looking for the best garmin watches for men  women of  these are some of the best garmin watches for men  women on

lucki think its beneficial to have a data comparison one say a current workout session to a best workout as recorded in the watch seeing  colorcoded graphs data is great but a comparison can lead to further improvement if youre improving at allso the garmin tactic delta solar ballistic cannot make it to the list damn i was gonna buy that onethinking of getting myself one do any of them track

or  years watch goes to garbage sham on garminhaving owned garmin sports watch i would say its lousy way too expensive for its crappy features and the watch would reset by itself time to time so the

am in my late s recently decided to get my butt in shape  lost  lbs and in the process picked up running as a result   the fr would be an awesome tool to help me advance in running and train for my first half marathoni deserve a fr because i love cycling and the outdoor lifestyle with  years of road cycling and over  miles in legs ive been riding for over  years i ride every dayi am the happiest when on the bikei need a fr because i am in a stressful timei am a sucker for a classic alu frame skinny tyres rim brakeswhat really matters is to be active with passion and sharing that experience with othersi think i can do a lot more with this garmin opportunity to enhance the cycling experience finding inspiration in the details and feeling peace in the neverending horizon so much to take in so much left to explorecycling has a massive positive impact on my life and i will never take that for grantedmy mental spai deserve the new garmin fr because i recently got into triathlon after taking a  year hiatus from sport due to two hip surgeries i had i was  months off needing a hip replacement aged  all recovered now this new watch would give the opportunity to explore freedom through running cycling and swimming and achieve what i never thought would be possible i deserve the new garmin fr because i have recently dipped my toes into trail running and need maps in my life so i feel safe and wontget lost forever also about to start a  training block for my first half marathon but most importantly it would fit perfectly on my garmin watch tan line i think i may deserve a new  as my fenixs is finally getting old with battery life dwindlingps all of the major new features being presented in a relaxing way thats nice to listen toi deserve the new garmin fr because i did my first sub  at the edinburgh marathon on sunday and im not sure my legs will ever be the samei deserve the new garmin fr because i have started training with a method called maffetone extremely frustrating running slow but looking at a shiny new watch might make it a little less painful  looking to complete some half marathons later this year improving my times using this new way of training i deserve the new garmin fr solar because i am overweight and lazy i know i know a watch wont make you healthy i  am beginning training for our upcoming weddinglord help me i have a suit i desperately need to fit into not sure butter and a shoe horn will get me into it the map function is helpful because i get lost when stepping into the backyard to be honest ive taken up running as a meditation and exercise training i really like that this watch has the race day set up and the morning breakdown setting up points to let friends and family know where i am in a race when i hit a mark is great also the find my phone option ive liked and subscribed love the casual and thorough reviewi deserve a fr because im taking on the outlaw nottingham in july and this watch is made for long days out like that the addition of the solar charging might relive the small stress that my watch will run out of battery halfway through the marathon meaning the shame of my strava not being right the race widget sounds awesome for planning  pacing the whole day and it feeds my data geek obsession for recording everything one more thing i need a couple of new doorstops and the seriously dench instruction manuals sound ideali believe i might deserve the new garmin fr because on sunday i attempted to run the edinburgh half marathon and failed pretty miserably i was on track for a shiny new pb when nature called for the second time that morning spicy wagamamas and a can of lager the night before was maybe not the best fuelling strategy  as i was trying to seek out water and a potential portaloo i lost concentration tripped myself up and almost faceplanted thankfully i stopped myself however in the process of doing so i pulled all the tendons in my left foot and had to do a hobbleofshame to a portaloo with a rather swollen foot and then get a bus to the finish line after only running five miles  i believe the new garmin fr features such upahead could help me in future races to be better prepared and avoid further clumsy scenarios in addition the live tracking feature would be useful as i had to hobble and wipe my salty tears completely alone on sunday as there was no event live tracking the stamina feature could also prove beneficial as there is a strong possibility my stomach upset and lack of concentration were as a result of fatigue and silly pacing  and finally the mention of the solar battery could also prove very useful as im hoping to complete a  ironman in september to commemorate the end of my s i think with my tortoisepaced swimming my inability to clip in to my bike and the fact that i have a purple foot and im not sure howifwhen ill run again i could do with all the batterylife and help i can get to get me to the finish linei deserve the new garmin fr because i have been doing general running and athletics for my local athletics club for many years i have competed in both m and m and have done reasonably well in both but have lost out many times because i havent paced my self correctly if i were to have this watch i would be able to pace myself better and hopefully get on the top step of the podium more often also i have recently entered into my first full triathlon as i have been unable to do one because of being under  the watch would really help as my current garmin  does not have a triathlon mode having the triathlon mode would also encourage me into doing longer triathlons in the futurei deserve the new garmin forerunner  because ive been working in a hospital covid unit for the past  years now been running and dropping weight so far as i gained lbs during the pandemic due to high stress in my covid unit  thank youi deserve the new garmin fr because i seriously want to get in better shape and have a decent gps watch for hiking and exploring more of my country as a student money is quite short but i know for sure this watch will motivate me to get out more and not stay inside studying for hours which is bad for the health thanks for the excellent review i like wigglei deserve the new garmin fr as i have just recovered from an acl injury and can use a sportswatch to keep me motivated during my condition buildup btw thanks for the excellent information in the videoi deserve the new garmin fr because last year i decided to have a go at trail running instead of road for this i picked a half marathon race up  munros  and got  months of achillies issues for my troublei deserve the new forerunner  because ive had to replace the rubber strap keeper on all my previous garmin watches so a garmin watch that has a replacement in the box is a dream come truei deserve the new garmin forerunner  because i am trying to come back to triathlons after having a child and my old  is rapidly giving up the ghost

running with my phone in pocket what was really uncomfortable and even this incovenience i have never bought smartwatch with gps but i believe new garmin might begin a new chapter in my running world

the new garmin fr because im a high school runners whos taken my training to the next level i need this watch not only to track my runs but also my heart rate and sleepi deserve the new garmin forerunner  because its one of the best garmin watches ever i run in the woods a lot and the gos accuracy on my current watch isnt that good especially when i am doing speed work in the woods the paces arent precise this is annoying since i want to analyse my run as good as possible the new health features are also something really handy for me i am a high performance triathlete who trains around  hours while going to school with these health features i can see if the body is ready for a hard workout or not the touchscreen is also something which i think is a very nice feature to have because it will make it easier to do things on your watchi deserve the new garmin fr as i planning to do a triathlon this year and i really want to track all the key metrics of my performance thank youi deserve the new garmin fr  because i make up words too although i dont have a random bike wheel hanging on my wall maybe thats what i need to become seriously benchgreat reviews gus  thanks i

whole pandemic situation i started running and completed my first half marathon in april time to step up my game with the fri deserve the new garmin fr because i completed my first ever trail marathon

races during my classes i take advantage of these moments to make you aware of the importance of solar panels and solar recharging in a watch of this caliber seems extraordinary to me i must also say that at almost  years old i run between  and  km every day in addition to doing calisthenics and i would love to know what my physiological age is which i estimate to be much lower than my physical

i need a more versatile and accurate gps watch as i begin my progression from a runner to a triathlete i have been using the forerunner  for the past few years to track my runs but now having recently started open water swimming ive discovered that the gps tracking is atrociously bad in water the multiband gps in the fr looks like a gamechanger in this respect the other two features that would help

annoyingly frequent occurrencei have a forerunner  it is starting to play up  so  would love to upgrade to a interesting review after several weeks of using my  i noticed that even if the barometric

without the incident detectioni deserve the new garmin fr because i want to wiggle my way through the dench product information and safety booklets whilst pointing the watch at the sun so that i save on my electricity bills shame that in the uk means getting rained on good job it comes with a charging cable di deserve the new garmin fr because this will get me ready to go back on the roads and trails rather than on the treadmill the incident detection i can use because i got hit in the back of the head with a bat and had to walk  miles home to tell the wife and call the police i am also get lost on when on runs the mapping can really help mei deserve the new forerunner because i ran a km mountain trail at the weekend and i had to record it in  parts because my watch died recharged it at

any of the fancy built in metrics like hrv training load running power music or any of that but i still want it though but thats pretty much only for my vanitys sake  the how big is it part of your review was the only part that really caught my interest id like a bigger watch than my current fr because it just looks more bad ass and makes me feel more bad ass lol thats pretty much my main motivation as a previously over weight middle age guy i started running about two years ago and just did my first marathon solo in  and now ive got all kinds of hubris wanting to run a sub k do trail ultras and yada yada and getting this watch is another aspect of that same hubris i believe i mean im pretty sure that just looking at the damn thing on my wrist would inspire me to try to be as good as the actual good runners who actually deserve to wear these to me that joy of inspiration is whats fun about this kind of tech a lot more than the actual tech pi deserve the garmin fr because i need to record the full extent of my wiggling around the ironman ireland course i dont want to get to the end and it not have countedi deserve the new garmin fr because i decided to book in for my first

have some nice updates compared to previous years batery time is longer not because of technichal updates but a soon to be  months old baby has included an emergency start option full functionality cant be promised in this mode i wish i existed in solar edition but since small children arent aloud to get exposed to sun i havnt really seen any this year i do know that navigating this foresty trail in life would feel easier if the pretty average rasmus would get the long awaited update of a garmin on his pretty average wristi deserve a fr because im drowning in potential smart watches to

owned three of their cycling computers my experiences with them gave me great confidence that i wouldnt be disappointed with the and i was right learned a couple of tips from your video so will be applying those in the future thanks againcan you see your vomax with thishi which watch do you prefer between the garmin forerunner  and the garmin venu sq to start withhey ryan looks great i see some deals on it how would you say it compares to other mid range garmins say the vivoactive im looking for my first gps running on a budget should i get the original instinct over this watch at the same priceultra marathoners have my respect i strive to be oneafter  years my polar vantage v battery suddenly drained it pushed me to decide to either renew a battery or buy a watch after seeing the price and function of f i decided to return to garmin running society i was surprised by the functions of f but disappointed for polar v if the battery of f could survive for  years and be renewable that would be great it the rechargeable battery cannot run more than  years i thought it was not an environment friendly producti just got this my first proper running watch very disappointed in the pace reading its all over the place one moment im running at  pace the next  the next  and so on im used to using the runkeeper app on my phone which has an average pace option which is consistent this phone doesnt seem to have that it only seems to have current pace  can anybody help with a suggestion about this please its really frustrating thanks btw nice review liked and subbed what version of the watch do they have but without gps cause i dont need it i dont think i need itim soldim torn between this and the  im new to running and id use it mainly for running hiking and going to the gym

strava will it be sync to garmin apps through stravadoes it automatically track a walk  as an exercise say walking a dog  if you dont have gps  turned on im assuming it wont show a map if it uploads to strava  is the forerunner  better  or what do you recommend for walkinghi when my running activity recorded with the garmin forerunner  is uploaded to strava it does not show any map of where exactly i ran is this just not possible with this garmin or is it a setting i have to changecan you connect wireless headphones and listen to musicdoes it have sleep tracking featuredoes this work in remote places without internet network connectioni am thinkin about that one i am using tom tom runner which i bought  years ago and still works very good but this garmin is looking so good in my city price is usdi have returned mine twice as the background colour is purple and not black   in instances where the background is white the writing is purple instead of black does the watch work for running and calculating mileage without a phonei got mine  days ago and ive had to charge it twice im thinking of returning ithi how does the  compare to the do i need to run with my phone to save my time on strava or can i run with only the garmin forerunner  and save the strava time after the run from my watch to phone strava app if so i need to buy the garmin forerunner   i want a watch were i only need the watch when i run and save progress after on stravahow do i respond to text msgsjust bought one hope its going to work out well  year old device ive got my doubts but the reality is i just dont know what to expect from a real quality brand amazfit was disappointingi dont use a phone can the  be used alonereally informative video i am awaiting the harming from same ebay seller apologies i bought prior to watching your videocan you swim with itcan i swim with this watchggi would say that the biggest deciding factor is your budgeti am a sales rep at a lbs this video is helpful and pertinent as the plethora of devices and features continuously expands this content is essential for helping me meet riders needs as well as my ownthank you for clarifying my decisionmaking process dude my head was spinning after researching by computersthe big advantage of garmin devices is you are allowed to use third party maps like velomap to navigatewill it be worth the  in  or is it worth waiting for the release edge you did an outstanding job on presenting the various options and capabilities of the garmin units  i am in my late shealthy fit and active  ive always loved bicyclingand in retirement ive developed an interest in gravel tour bikepacking  as i spent two careers in challenging and often fraught with danger professions military and federal law enforcement i have no wish to entertain unnecessary danger in my recreation  i have had too many close calls with vehicles on the road too many damned drivers staring at screens i would guess  funny as how this video is presenting a screen to bicyclists  anyway my question i know that you can front load a route in some deviceswhat im looking for is a bike computer that can depict off pavement routing so lets say i want to ride my bike across massachusetts outskirts of boston to stockbridgei want to avoid paved roads to greatest extent possible  do i have to know those gravel roads rail trails twin track roads  or is there a device that i front load my parameters and input origin and destination  again you did a great job of explainingim just looking for greater detail how a particular unit will perform  thanks again  bravozulu very well donehello i have a question i use the garmin  but i dropped it now the screen looks fun i might be looking to go another  what would you recommend i ride road about  times a week  milesanyone using edge  or  plus as an extended display for garmin fenix because it does not use gps and connect to many sensors as a normal use i wonder how long its battery is going to last for more than  hours claimed or notneed edge  with usbc and climbprothankswould like to see the  get an update that allows di compatibility dont much care for anything else like climb promy main concern with garmin edge  is how bad the navigation is once you started the course you cant modify it when you get off course navigation wont guide you back on course is there any upgrade that fixes these problemsdurability is higher with phone with special casescan we change the map region for example from the south east asia map to united states or europe thanksdo you have to pay any subscription to use the gps i need reading glasses this puts me off from investing in onecarmn is the nokia of the cycling world how about updating the app and interface with features like wahoo to be able to load a route on demand btw on my edge  the screen died i opened the device and it was just a lose connector really poor garminusing edge and fenix for yearsbut waiting for when the maps will show up for indiajust open the api for rd parties mappers peoplebattery  life continues to improve year after year   you obviously didnt live through the s and early snice good thothanksi got jumpscared when i saw the prices of these used is an option but ill still go with my old phone heavier and less battery ill keep using sound navigation and turning the screen on when neededi have a garmin epix  do you think it is worth it to get a cycling computer as well or can i download and display the route on my watchi got the forerunner  and its been great lightweight and has most of the best features it was fun seeing mike on the street in chamonix welcome back bro i bought the enduro the same day i met you in chamonix love itlove your video all garmin watch comparison videos i found are talking about colors of the watches and bandsso irrelevanteverything in your video is super relevant and i am really impressed you can do such in depth analysis about them all o really big thank you i intend to get the  i especially want the multiband gps i race a fair bit and in some places where the distance and pace can be off  i hate it when i go out too hard thinking im not going fast enough or thinking im on pace and then missing my target timei love the epix so far its been a perfect watch for me great video well doneloved my  just upgraded to the  and its had a lot of features added good list guys  i like the flex on this one had my  since release day   still my everyday carryi sold  to buy fs for lactate threshold test and ability to dim backlight lol but other the those two things  is incredible good watchbought a fr  on ebay used but bought on  so i got a nearly new fr  for   with shipping good enough for mereally good video guys i have a suunto  which i think is a good allrounder but am ramping up my running in preparation for a hm in the spring just picked up a  on an amazon deal for  it feels a bit plasticky compared to the suunto and was considering stepping up to the fenix   and id have to try  move on the suunto soon the back of this video i think ill keep the  as a dedicated run watch and use the suunto for hikes etcwhich of the entry level watches can u add running pod for running analysisi was just thinking last night whats the best running watch for my needs mine is getting long in the tooth and its time for a new one as i return to running from an injury i have a  and its great but im watching this thinking do i need a  or fenix  probably not but its temptingi have a garmin fr  music i dont use the music now when im running im thinking on update for the  fenix  or enduro  and now im doubt with epix  first problem money i have the money but im not sure if is really necessary a watch too much expensive i think finally dont change my watch and when my frm died i will buy other lolhi can you tell me where i can buy epix for the price you put up on screen please i got a  on discount and an hrm pro  i think this combo gives me everything i needmaybe top budget watchsmart band for runnersforerunner  vs venu  plus which one would you suggestgreat overview thanks many of us are getting a bit older and now use readers so seeing distance is fine but readingglancing at fine print like the watch face while were actually running is hard to do arent there any accessibility features like larger fonts on the garmin watches like my fenix  for example i could live with a limited screen with only time heart rate and distance but in larger fontsim looking an upgrading from apple to garmin can you use apps like nike run club on garmin watches as im doing a marathon training plan on nrcbeen looking at upgrading my fenix x got the wife the fenix s solar and she loves it km looking at the epix  but wondering with not being i a rush of theres good odds there will be a mid cycle refresh in their usual january announcements about vivoactive  is misleading   the watch may work with external sensors but it will receive heart rate only  and not running dynamicsi am surprised no fenix  with all the latest updates it just receivedi just want a better solution for zone training with hr strap than the iphone most of the tracking means nothing to methe thing that still stops me getting a garmin or anything other than an apple watch is the lack of audible support as someone who mostly runs listening to audiobooks this means id have to take my phone which is a deal breaker for me guys theres a ton of great info for us here  could you present a bit more slowly so we  maybe just me  can take it in please   thank you the question i have  is extra  euro worth for epix  vs  i mean the screen is nice but is it extra  nicehas anyone had major gps issues with the garmin fenix  x pro great watch but have to use it with my stryd pod for accuracydam that  vo max score i recently got the  as a replacement for the vivoactive  wanted the extra buttons the bezel on the  was just too thick and its only slightly cheaper and the  is  euro more than the surprised by your comments about the fenix  pro  the gps really isnt that poor i get the sense youre a little obsessed with thisfor most runners it more than performs on the fenix   also garmin have a great rep with continued software upgrades on older models  finally you can pick up the fenix  pro for as little as  nowfor half the price of the  its well worth itwhich set of watches do both of you use personally best watch by farat  your wrist looks rather wooden  you might want to consult your dr  great comparison  what features do you think garmin will add to the epix fancy a garmin marq athleteseems like a discussion about the whole garmin range not enough strong recommendations in my opiniondid i hear that fella say he now runs k a week i still dont know why oh why i get an apple watch im eager to sell it and get my garmin fenix sevenive since done a review of the garmin zumo xt thats here httpsyoutuberkpimvjathis has to be the most hilarious offthecuff english dryhumor motorcycle channel i have ever listened to its like hugh grant shaved his head grew a beard and fell in love with a motorcycle too awesomeanother zumo xt fan here i like all the features you mentioned and when it is paired with your phone it also displays calls and messages which can be quite handy if youre out for a ride when you should be at worki knew civilization was finished when mcdonalds started calling themselves a restaurantawesome quick wit well explained after a few reviews pretty much convinced the xt is the way to roll on my adventure bikekeep the sunny sideupthank you i enjoyed the fly on your head in the first segment nice video learned a biti love the dedicated navi concept still my old garmin was solid and never had issues with signal  great reviewive been searching for reviews and this way the best ive found good workjust watched your review i couldnt stop chuckling i do love your humour anyway youve convinced me im going for the garmin xthi tim just happened across this video im with you on the phone in the pocket and dedicated gps on the bike have a garmin montana which ive had for around yrs now that has served me well looking to upgrade to the zumo xt for the bigger screen  got old  and this review has sold it for me love your outlook and humour now liked and subscribed to your channel just bought a zumo xt for my ktm also subscribed to my ride basic whilst waiting to have it fitted to the bike your review has convinced me that ive done the right thing thanksthis was all i needed to finalize my purchase decision thanks a lot for the great video and perfectly clear informationive had mine for over a year and didnt know it did any of thatexcellent vid again thanksgot the zumo and agree with everything you say in this video its a great piece of kit love itgreat video i use my phone as primary but on trips i also take the zumo xt im in the us and traveling through the mountains you will loose cell signal we nearly ran out of gas and had trouble finding a gas station after that i purchased the zumo as a backup i will use it to import map files for preplanned routes but i really dont use it to its full potential thank you for the reminder of its other features weather is a big onei randomly came across your video today and i have to say i love your humor and you will have a longtime viewer in meclear and reasonable analysis thanks buddy cheers from brazilgood honest review and comparison subscribed looking forward to seeing morei appreciate the review thank you i agreeexcellent fantastic review love the humor keep them comingi had to stop partway through this is comedy genius loving itnow back to the videoi also haveuse a garmin xt and love it  i know old tech compared to a modern smartphone but the reasons you mention are all relevant and real  i live in the southwest of the us and in the summer months temperatures can be quite warm sometimes over c and i have experienced the dreaded overheating scenario with my phone which became quite inconvenient when riding somewhere i had never been before  also another feature of a smartphone is to automatically dimdarken the screen in certain scenarios  also happens always at the most inappropriate times at least for me and my phone  i will always have a dedicated gps unit on my bike designed to handle the environment and activity of riding a motorbikegreat talk about the zumo xt as i got one  coming for xmas    cant waitinteresting review thank you tim i have experience of using older garmins on bikes and recognise that speed was definitely an issue if you deviated from the route it expected you to take you could be faced with further route decisions before it had caught up my preferred navi solution on my bike for a couple of years has been a beeline  i love the simplicity and having my phone still in my pocket but recognise the limitations of the system and that it is not for everyone and not a solution if you want proper mapping i am in the process now of setting up my old phone as a satnav on my bike yes with quadlock and will be interested in how that works  main driver for that is to be able to use the rallymoto roadbook app on my bike which needs a phone to work but i will also undoubtedly use normal navi apps as well when i want a change from my beeline which sits alongside the phone on a givi accessory barreally good video buddy  i am about to make the leap to the xt having used the nav v for for years on the bmw gs  made the move to triumph and now need a new satnav  the xt is a chunk of change but i think your video has swung it  thank yougreat balanced and informative vid thanksive ordered onethank you to sharing you thoughtsgreat vid and love your sense of humor thank youfrom one brit to another you nailed it mate im soldi found when driving lgvs or delivery vans that i used my dedicated satnav for main guidance but used my phone to get postcodes for cafes petrol stations etc do the same on my bike so best of both worldsthank you for the review it was very helpful and it wasnt a boring topic at all i purchased a zumo xt today to mount onto my bike for the same reasons you did its too bad you didnt show the topo map and birds view that was in the product description those are features im really looking forward to checking outive used tom tom garmin and phone apps for a road bike i think the sat nav is the easiest option do note that a mount to lock the garmin on the bike or to use on multiple bikes will cost just as much as quad lock i ride road and trails so a phone gives me apps for both styles of riding and allows me use the appmap thats best for the country im in overall for mixed riding and multiple bikes i think the phone wins by a small marginive had many zumos over the years  lm xt and now the xt  ive used them on the bike and the car  wouldnt be without onei have had mine on my wrr for over a year and it keeps all my offroad routes for later use with a another mount it clips right on to my ktm  with no problem and allows me to chose single track two track or black top routeslove it brilliant thanks matejust returned from mexico used the zumo the whole time it was terrific just to add to this very useful review during my last winter trip to krystallrally norway my garmin has performed perfextly in temperatures down to c whilst all of my friends mobile phones and tablets gave up at cso in one hit you loosing navigation and callforhelp resourcesgreat info there and cant go without mentioning the bike it looks awesomejust purchased one of these for my multisrada enduro great video and really helpful cheers timwell done interesting review  and i agree with youhi i used a garmin  on my previous bike a triumph i for quite while i  covered parts of france and spain picos initially it struggled with the mac but i eventually managed to get it work ok with basecamp using an ordinary  button mouse  didnt like track pad and mac magic mouse  i created several routes on the mac and transferred them to the old garmin  with out any problem although some of the routes were a bit quirky sometimes routing down an off slip road on a motorway and then back up the on slip road the maps are def out of date now but i still occasionally use locally if  in my wifes older car that does not have a sat nav great video thnxfunniest and most factual motorcycle reviews subscribedi have the identical setup and find it great within its limitations i also purchased the touratech locking dock which allows me to leave it on the bike when its in view without some light fingered so and so making it disappear everyone i know whose had a quad lock has had issues from them disintegrating or disengaginghmmmmdamn i loved the energy of this video so much subbedhi tim im the same i dont like my phone on my bike  you have just convinced me to buy the zumo xt  cheers i couldnt agree more i dont want my phone bouncing on the handlebar and risking loosing it and yes zumo xt might be expensive but a new top phone nowadays is way over that price also i live in spain and i have had some overheating problems with my phones when navigatingchargingmusic during my summer rides thats what finally made me get a dedicated gps a few years agojust stumbled on your channel youre freaking hilarious i just had the rear camera on my iphone replaced after  miles of riding with it on the handlebars of my himalayan now that wasnt vibration isolated on the other hand i rode for  miles on the same bike and the same mount with my motorola g and it didnt have any camera problems now to be fair the one flaw in that phone is it couldnt really make a phone call lifes about giveandtake i guessgreat review and very helpful  seriously thinking about this what is the speedometer like  is it accurate and does it pick up all speed trapsafter having owned a navigon  navigon  zumo  and zumo  i vowed never to own a garmin again i have been using tomtom rider  for years now and my goodness how much simpler and better that works and for a much lower price nonetheless i think it is time that the  gets un updateim doing a lot of research into getting a sat nav for my own bike biggest worries are battery life and of plugged in to the bike if it will kill it as i want to get a bikedash cam too i have see a youtube creater put the phone under a tap and it no longer responded or changed screens because you cant lock it the speaker and suction cup are for use while in a car or hiking as you can change the travel modei definitely agree a dedicated gps is the best option for the reasons you mentioned  the phone is better with you in case something happensand i subscribed straight after than intro zumo xt for me the larger font size is so much easier to read especially with all the vibrationshi tim  love the channel  can i ask what mount you used to mount the garmin onto your nav bar  just got the zumo and a givi nav bar  mm   but finding a decent non cheap plastic bracket is a bit elusive  thanks and safe riding  maf in brightonyup agreednice review does it cover the whole world or do you have to load different maps in it and do they charge more for those mapsi couldnt make my mind up on this one having had with nightmare with a garmin navigator  and all of its uncontrollable screen problems i had almost decided never to buy another garmin and just go with a phone mount  after seeing your video my mind was changed what swung it was being able to get  off by having bennetts insurance ive been with them for a few years  just an offer i couldnt refuse  thank youthank you for the helpfull video but i am struggling to find dirtoffroad roads in my phone does this garmin know offroad roads to travelthanks for this really entertaining clip i use garmin xt since a while now and i am happy with it it does a good job i do have a quadlock mount as well for my phone but i am actually not sure whythe only thing i hate with the garmin but this was also an issue with my former tomtom it starts to go wild when rain is heave enough since it thinks raindrops are fingertips but this is pretty much the only negativ i can say about my garmingreat video just a couple of questions i only have a phone no computer i phone  pro can i download onto the xt from that also will it show green lanes are they already installed excuse my lack of tech knowledgegreat video bought itlike a which magazine crossed with a carry on film ooh matron fantastic review timalso the drive app is great for typing in addresses quicklyfor my upcoming tour of south america i am happy that garmin has licensed ioverlander data to display in the xtbeen using my quadlock for  years i bought the one with vibration dampner i ride  miles nearly per day had no issues with my phone and i have the same phone as youim very much against my phone on my handlebars  they have become too important to us with the info they have at hand for our ease of use my iphone was over k not a top of the range but certainly around what you expect to pay for iphone  it has all my important information on it  banking etc  if it became detached  stolen or damaged id be lost if you lost your phone and were stuck beside the road do you remember your wifes or riding friends numbers  breakdown contact your insurance company even the hotel your going to  even finding a roadside phone box is pretty difficult nowadays if somehow you can recall anything  i have got the xt as well and its brilliant i challenge you to turn your phone off and see how many numbers you can remember  dont forget also if your phones damaged you might not be able to use internet either to help you out great review  im new to the gps world is there a monthly subscription andor cost to download maps local or internationalthanks for the video ive been debating on gettng one of these i ride my bike so i can forget about my phone lol i prefer it in the tank bag hidden awayi think i might invest in the xtslintei really want one of these and if i still had an adventure bike would get one in an instant i now have an r ninet though and cant find a way to mount one without it looking ridiculous great reviewi would like to know how to import a list for example an excel table of points of interest directly from a pc to the garmin zumo xt or how can i add pois defined by coordinates via computerthanks for the video i was just about to buy one from a local retailer for  when you mentioned the bennetts rewards checked it out and i saved  thank you for the tiphi what about that round trip thing you ever tried is it comfy to usei like this and you are funny thanksi picked up my first bike yesterday from the shop it was a km trip back home and it took me  hours because i kept getting lost  my km had become km i had tried memorizing the map before leaving but had to find a petrol station which threw my mental map out of kilt had to keep stopping to look at the phone as it was very difficult while trying to ride and probably illegal verdict  need a gps  and was looking at this one very timely review thanks  ps cant believe the size of that monitor on the ktm  its huge shame you they dont partner up with garmin to offer gps functionality on that big screenjust upgraded from a zumo  to the xt  i tried to use an old phone and not even closeive had it for almost a year in canada it costs  tax worth every penny there is a lot of areas without the cell coverage where it works flawlesslycouldnt agree more  youll notice im one of those motorcycle influencers who isnt sponsored by quad lock either  i was one of the the first to use a quadlock it completely trashed my  phone camera and quadlocks answer was a few months later buy a vibration dampener  stablehorsebolted  like you ill never risk another phone with them again vibro dampener or noti ve never considered being distracted by music a benefit to safe riding nor to enjoyment of the bike or the journey  i keep my phone for calls and photos and thats it  i prefer a dedicated satnav for touring  bmw navigator allows curvey route alternatives multiple way points and the ability to skip any  waterproof less to lose if damaged and just perfect for the jobim still using my older phone for my sat nav so vibration not a problem i divert my good phone that i keep in my pocket to the old phone and i can also see who is calling me when im riding and can also textphone etc from the old phone on the bike in front of mealso i can charge my phone from the usb charger and swap it from bike to bike the only downfall i would say is the screen is not as bright as a sat nav many thanksgreat review does the garmin come with all you need to mount and wire it in or do you need some extra bitsthanks for that mate  great review  you can get a tourtech lockable mount to  how do you hard wire it to your bike great video  ive a new tenere  coming and ive spent days and days trying to find a phone solution  theyre really expensive and there are loads that wont ship nice mounts to the ukthanksgood information there i am running a second phone in my bmw cradle via an inexpensive adaptor and using calimoto mainly but with the option to use google maps and all was good and i especially like calimotos clear speed camera warning  my troubles have begun to surface in the the vibration dust ingress etc has made the usb charge port a bit loose so the phone now intermittently charges and is getting worse so there is another potential pitfall there with phone use i can get it repaired for about  but as another option ive been looking at the garmin xt  nav  is crap now sits in a drawer  especially as its easy to load routes in via wifi does the garmin offer speed camera warnings especially in europethe greatest issue with the gps units ive tried has been performance since all of the chips are being thrown at phones  perhaps the better move is to switch to gps units without screens that a phone can connect to for gps data and display through a dedicated app otherwise the gps could just use faster chips with more memory id like to see that and a return to resistive touch screens with interfaces based on taps rather than slides and big directional  volume buttonsa phone is ok for around town but a more rugged weatherproof device with large screen texticons focused on just directionsmapping is better for long trips theres less need for it to be smallslim so they good be built to be handled and repairedi use a garmin car sat nav theyre a third of the price of a specific bike sat nav and does the same jobgood review question does spotify still work on the xt via the phonefirstlove that bike im riding a  s  currently i have the  thinking of upgrading to the  xt do you think the extra real estate is worth the upgradeeric black swan odysseysi use a garmin montana because i do a lot of offroad and i can send messages or sos over satellite without any signals  i still think its a pain to use so i mostly use my phone and run them both when touring  never had a phone die on me and if i did i always have applecare so id just walk into any apple store and get ii replaced or repairedhello fking thank you i never thought it was a good idea to mount my phone on the handle bars youve summarized my exact feelingsopinions about the phonestandalone gps argument although i dont recall having the accentdoes this show live traffic like on your phone so yiu can re route if you see jams up ahead to where your riding toquick question can you lock the sat nav to the mount to stop it getting stolen as i can with my tom tomthe older we get the harder is is to read the smart phones in the sun then the iphone will get hot and go dim i order the garmin no brainer thanks for the entertaining videoi too prefer a sat nav to phone great tip about bennetts insurance been looking at an xt just got one through bennetts for  odd but does it come off the mount when off the bitumen some sort of twist or locking mechanism would be piece of mindgreat video question for you as i could not find it on the garmin site do you need to connect to your phone to use the weather appim curious why you dont use the app with your ktm tft that connects your phone to the display i have the norden  expedition which came with the husqvarna connect app my phone stays in my pocket connected via bluetooth to my bike i can navigate maps music pretty much everything via the control buttons on the left side of the handlebar the same buttons that control ride settings etchi could you advise what aluminium mount that is youre using for the garmin it looks very sturdy and ideal for my new adventure r that i have on order thanksi use sat nav because it doesnt over heat and people cant call me when i need to know which way to turn also i dont get distracting nonsense on sat navshi there im new to bike in and i have kawasaki versus  gt would you recommend this satnav are the newest one xtfor the music app can you control the music from playing in your phone or do you have to uploaded it to the garmin unit wondering if it can handle multiple bluetooth connections so i can pair both the phone to garmin and headsetmaybe you find it a stupid question     but can you put movies and music on a sc card and play them right on the garmin xt does is also play flac music files or only mp  the movies could be usefull when in the tent at the eveningnow i have the  world edition   i can only find the xt that is for europe   would it be possible to put on a few other countries on the sd card fe when you go from turkey to iran  it would be silly if you have to use your phone while having a dedicated gps device in your sightdoes anyone know how to connect the sena r to it have a big probleminteresting video ive used my phone in an ultimateadons case  but thats a pain when you want to take a quick photo a garmin or tomtommaybe a second phone is my way ahead and i still use a thing  you may have heard of it  called a  map  i fold up a page of the map and put it in my ultimateadons case cheers stevei just order the xt replacement for my  year old zumo i thought this summer i would just use my iphone on my harley did not work for these reasons screen too small on iphone  and it vibrate too much for my old eyes to see itwould be interesting to see the beeline moto reviewcan you geocache with the zumo xtgreat info im in texas and once one gets outside of the cities there are many areas with no cell phone signal and the same in other states so a phone is not a good optionget the rain poncho for your phone on quad lock and you are good to gocan you play music apps on an ios device and control them through a bluetooth headsetwhat would be even more brilliant is a zumo xt with carplay over wifi or even usb carplay wifi adapters abound on amazonebayalietci think im right in thinking that your phone  may incur roaming charges depending on your service provider and country which wasnt mentionedi have  a r gs and keep procrastinating over this satnav or the nav do u have to have a computer or mac to use it to its fullest can it find byroadsi wonder if to buy this although now i use my old samsung s for a satnav but my biggest issue with google maps is that i cannot save a route how i want it but  eur for this i am still thinkingalso if you ride in areas where cell service is not available or spotty  a navigation system will still workis this water proof and does we need to download all the maps or it work like a google map like start point and end pointphone based navigation is fine for commuting and people who dont care about riding good routesnow dropped the iphone and garmin gps for the carplay units c to use calimoto google maps wazes and pandora music  so far not missing the garmini use maps on iphone when i want to find something on the road and send it to garmin drive to send it to xt find something in garmin is always a painlets be honestthe youngins whod probly mostly never get caught dead on an adventure bike the trend is definitely changing though  riders after  start to have close up vision problems when on trips i prefer to have a dedicated larger screen for nav and trying to fumble with a tiny screen with gloves on for me there is no comparison they are different toolsand one should never replace the othergreat vidi sold sold my tomtom  because it was too slow fine until you get out of signal range then youve no satnav now looking to buy a better satnavyes its worth it mini usb not micro which is very similar youre right thats an old connection wonder why it uses thatyes much prefer a satnav to a phone i use tomtom and it gives speed camera alerts eta miles remaining average speed through average speed cameras and has a side bar that shows distance to petrol stations speed cameras etc enroute does the garmin do this please edit what was the flys namethere are many fantastic riding spots on the east coast of the united states where cellular reception doesnt exist in the middle of the country its the same story im in the philippines right now and can confirm there are fairly large swaths of land where phones dont work were a very long time from where not having a gps on an adventure bike makes senseive got the zumo xt  quadlock which i dont use for all the reason outlinedthe other thing about phones in hot weather using nav will absolutely overheat your phone  it will shutdown the satnav wont worth it id rather have the zumo xt taking the abuse on my handlebar than my smartphone any day my one gripe with the xt is it does not want to connect with my sena smh bluetooth anyone else have that issue my sena is  years old it may just be time for an upgrademobile phones are for taking photos however next season  im going to mount mine next to my new xt just for  fun big calimoto fan with quadlock then i bought the xt now i hardly ever use my phone for navigation huge improvement over my bmw nav v too otherwise i use google maps as a back upi purchased the cheapest garmin gps i could which means its meant for a car but since i no longer ride in the rain it doesnt matter its mounted on something or other from amazon but has remained rock solid ever since the whole set up is probably less expensive than the qual lock mount alone my phone stays in my pocket and im a very happy camperi can confirm earlswood mcdonalds is terrible thanks for info in the video dude think im gonna have to get one for gpx tet routes the garmin is x better to read the screen on a sunny day compared to a phone screenas someone who lost their phone in an accident i would get one definitelyyes my phone was just a cheap one and i went down the oxford cliqr route as i am tight james bluntmy mountcase survived but my phone got sent to the stratospherenever suffered with vibrations as it was mounted centrallybut if you shell out every yrs for a over a bag of sand on a phonestick it somewhere safe and spunk  nuggetsmight be a bit ott for your usage but check out the carpe iter nav unit next level and what the garmin could be if they could size the carpe iter down to the xt size or thereabouts no one would buy anything elsei have the zumo xt and its got its strong points  however  i want a weather proof wireless android auto device so i can have the benefits without exposing my phone   it should have a bright functional touch screen same as the zumoi was using a phone on the bike until i got stuck in a downpour at night in the middle of nowhere the phone started screaming at me that its detecting waterno s had a beeline on the bike couldnt get it set up in the dark and in the rain so i got pied off bought a zumo xt next day phones are greatyes most of em dont like water thoughcan i record a journey without having to program a end destination i know with google you have to have a start and a finishdoes it do satellite viewseems like i need both still use a garmin montana  it just workspsa one is none and two is some as the gi saying goes so i always carry a topo map and compass whatever else i nav with my fourwheeled vehicles get a motor carriers road atlas bagged under the seat and a simple scout compass in the glove box practice land nav without the electronics until those are purely optional its not difficult and you wont have the lost lt expression on your face if your fancy gear diesthis might be a dumb question but ive only ever used google maps on my phone with this kind of satnavgarmin gadget is there a monthly bill like having a second cell phoneok one thing no one seems to comment on is that a sat nav doesnt get lost when there is no phone signal  travel through a place where there isnt a mobile phone signal with a zumo or other dedicated sat nav no problem  but get lost when using google maps or whatever on a smartphone when there isnt any mobile signal and youre still lostthe phone requires an internet connection to work the gps properly my zumo is fully self contained and will work every time my zumo is waterproof and the touch screen works with my gloves i will never stop using my zumo and will use my cell phone to make phone calls as it is intended to dophone screens arent as bright as the zumo and in my experience phones overheat when in direct sun unlike the zumo  there are ways around this mount the phone with lots of ventilation angle it downwards so as not to catch the sun etc but neither are issues w the dedicated nav systemzumo xts rule  particularly with that mount  agree with all your conclusions  i put a locking thingo on my gps  i also have an app on my phone that sends emails and alerts to the gps  hours of mindless funbefore looking at this vid i just ordered a quad lock as theyre  off at the minuteworst case for me would be a  insurance excess if the worst was to happeni had a quad lock mount with the vibration mount the case was awful and so tight pixel xl that when i tried to prise of the case it detached the screen from the body also the quad lock case is not easy to mount despite the advert showing it just popping on it doesnt you have to fart around with itthe ancient usb connector failed after a few months only plus it has over phone is screen visibility in suncompletely agree with you plus the smart phones gps relies on network connectivity most of the times and can not precisely tell where you are in some off road situation or mountains also the phone fails to detect your direction if you are not moving but dedicated gps is spot on all the time it happened so many times that google maps told me to go forward when i was static and then tell me to turn around because it detected the wrong direction while stoppedthere are loads of places not far from me where i cant get a signal on my phone and the garmin earns its keepif i did a lot of touring and adventure riding i would be much more interested in a dedicated gps but for urban riding and commuting which is really all i do i feel that my phone works better and its cheaperdont mention the pwarn regards from germany where speeding has become more expensive than a quad lock mountphone in conjuction with old car sat nav in cradle paper map in tank bag window and hand written list of cities towns to head for cant see any of it without my glasses  found the whole lot a total faff dangerous and distracting while on the move and really spoilt my ride most of the time now i just ride in the general direction till i need fuel then browse the maps and roughly memorize my route till the next stopthe old days riding my airhead bmw with a paper map seemed so much more fun in retrospect nowadays touring has become a chore and a worry google maps is ace for hotelcampfuelfood aside from that im just going to enjoy my ride how do i get one from bennets for phone is a better bet in virtually every situation in my experience phone sales dwarf satnav sales and the respective development budgets reflect thati just stumbled across your review video  i have a zumo xt that i am fairly happy with but would be much happier to use google maps for on road navigation and gaia for offroad or track navigation  for those that follow itchy boots she started a new season with a new gps  it appears to be a xenarc  tablet  it is available with either an  android or windows operating system and has a docking station for easy charging available  i am thinking of ordering the android version  i have posted a question on itchy boots youtube channel as to what gps app she is using but have yet to get a responseits good device this xt but sometimes in london it frustrates me with choice of route google maps does better job finding places and possibly has more direct routes using common sensei have the tom tom ride and its been very disappointingim looking to replace it with thisthese gorra fly on yer headgood video i lost my money after this by garmin  thanks a lot why the feck would you use a garmin to find a sodding mcdonaldswhy the feck would you use google maps to find a squiggly green lane east of finchingfieldexactly orses for courses nice video mateafter my second garmin edge  died unexpectedly i decided to try something different  the wahoo elemnt bolt instead of the garmin  boy im glad i did httpswwwyoutubecompostugkxxzctbwgdhvtbszrswepkvllhnin the display on the wahoo bolt is much easier to read i like the configuration of the display more up to  items visible on page  without scrolling and the first item chosen is larger characters than the next  rows that have pairs of items still very readable i also like the configurable item selections the bolt synced with my garmin ant speed sensors on both bikes easily so no additional investment was required there while the rated battery life is a couple hours less than the garmin  i easily get a weeks worth of  hour rides before recharging and its never really low on charge at the end of a ride syncing to the wahoo app strava and apple health app is painlessmost people think the red square around where it connects is a o ring but its just for looks its plastic ask me how i know gerardmer android devices with dedicated apps give you so many more options and can always change apps like gaia and others som much more can be done  buy a cheaper rugged android device and put whatever mapping you want your never stuck with just garmins softwarelots of laughshad one last year sold it after a few trips garmin need to sort the un intuitive software out  osmand maps and google maps is much betterthe main difference i see is a phone does not work outside mobile phone coverage whereas gps works everywhere i have a quadlock with mobile phone and able download offline maps and sound to my helmet  garmin are obsolete really in my opiniondedicated satnav all day long google infested devices will never be as good and that weather radar is a really useful feature price is a bit high tho at least for the computing power its got im sure it costs no more than about  to produce judging by the way it zooms in and out on the mapreally not comfortable using my flagship phone under such abuse my galaxy note  screen died and im convinced it was from the  degree heat during the summerhonestly i dont get why all the mounting options for smartphones except ram require a compatible phone case i dont wanna have a bad phone case all day because i use my phone for navigation on my bike also my phones camera was destroyed by my bikes vibrations once im now also a proud owner of a garmin gpsi think the value of the gadget feeling makes people buy navigation system google maps is still king  above tomtom and garmin and yes vibrations could cause a problem but than again do not go off road with your phone in a ram mount on highways it is perfect and saves me a lot of money on a external navi systemnew iphone is around i just found a newused garmin montana i for  on facebooksold the xtits awful purely awful my big issue with it is the complicated way to get a track into itthen once youve rubbed your tummy patted your head and hopped on one leg and you have the track in thereall your carefully selected waypoint icons are nowflagsnameless flagsbecause the xt also doesnt have icon labels the only thing it does will is picking a curvy road from point a to point bwhichif youre using a gps on a bike youve likely created a track you want to ride in some other software dont buy an garmin xtuse a montana  or  series on a bike if using tracks keep your phone safe in your pocketmy xt crap vague mount  never confident that it has clicked inconstantly tells me to do a u turn  constantlypretty hopeless really we usually use google maps because its mentaldo i recommend noi wasnt going to comment anyway and im certain this has been mentioned in the comments below but youve omitted the most important reason for a stand alone gps satellite navigation unit the stand alone sat nav doesnt rely on internet data to work  and trust me ive been to places where there was zero internet its the same reason i have all my music installed onto my phone because it doesnt matter where i am it will workyou forgot to mention when rain hits the screen i doesnt go mental like a phone doesyou can look at pornography lmfaooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo i subscribed just for that man thanks for the laughforget using a mobile in the south of europe in summer its too hot for it it will shut down they cannot be used in rain  and iphones are not built to take the vibrations on a motorbike good old satnavs will do the jobused to always reccomend tomtom because easier and cheaper but since the price has come down so much its basically a stealsurely if you want navigation you use the zumo and if you want a mcdonuts just get you phone out also gps devices are effective because they dont rely on coverage they use satellites and they can be found anywhere in the world just saying a good review though thank youphones should always be on the rider what if you get separated from the bike in a accident and cant get to iti prefer keeping the phone in my pocket  my phone is not weather proof eitherphones are as much use as a brick when there is no phone signal sat navs work in the middle of nowhere with or without a phone signal and you arent being trackedhi tim  thanks helpful review ive got turn by turn satnav on the bike dash supplied from my mobile on bluetooth running the bmw connected app  so yes phone is safe in my pocket it works well and has got me places i would never have found without it and like the xt there is a slider for choosing the degree of winding routes downside though beeline  triumph would be the same is no displayed map  which is making me consider a dedicated satnav one thing though  and i hope this can be taken the right way  enjoy your content including general irreverence but please drop the porn jokes not helpful and likely to alienate any lady bikers out therebut in texas usa the heat kills phones  big problem is silly to say the least to use a phone as a gps on a bike they small not have the color or brightness  generally rely on data plus get damaged as they for the pocket or panniers etcpeak design  quad lockslightly tounge in cheek but its  whole mins before you get to the garminjust switch off data roaming on your phone when crossing switzerlandi thought it was a coco pop mini usbif you ride proper dirt in sa you will rather want to have a zumo sat nav otherwise your phone will not work when you have finished your tripcheersand if you are in an area without cell service and didnt preset offline mode to download the maps for offline use you would be solit is so funny that all those phone versus satnav reviews always consider using an existing phone to a dedicated satnav why not review a dedicated rugged navigation phone it is cheaper faster better resolution waterproof glove capable runs  any nav app you may like you need to couple only one bluetooth device headset so no messing with the correct order of coupling it runs your favorite music app speedcam warning app tracking app compare an xt to a rugged phone it wil always lose simply buy a rugged phone combine it with a duolock instead of an overrated quadlock and you will still be cheaper and have better hardwarebut not all not gloves are leatherushaped bolt  usain bolti wonder what you think of the ottocast carplay lite c in comparison to the zumo xt i have and love my xt but now that theres a pocket android autocarplay for bikes all of that products videos are making like a zumo xt is a relic of a bygone era to be lamented and forgotten for the rest of time to the point that they make up complete bullshit lies about what the zumo xt can and cant doits really quite weird the lite c runs off of cell signal and everyone turns into a stuttering mess when i ask what happens if theres no cell signal aroundi didnt hear a word you said the first minute i was concentrating on that fly on your head  to  quid on fb market place get one with free updates garmin seal it cheap mount easy doneit looks underpowered as in cpu noticeable by ui lag you can buy a second hand waterproof phone like a  year old flagship from samsungonly real thing about this is the fact that i can work it with just normal gloves all the rest is nonsense my phone can do bettera gps has a more reliable signal than a phone the gps gets its signal from a satellite whereas the phone depends upon line of sight to a cell tower yes the gps can temporarily lose its signal if blocked by a mountain or tunnel but generally its stronger and more accessible than a cell signalthe main thing never ever tomtomyour sat nav is in car mode you should switch to motorcycle mode the routing will be bettergarmin is dyingi see the minimal benefits but i can do anything i need with one devicevery entertaining especially for someone with a taste for sht hamburgersja s german pornthe garmin software on a mac mini is slow outdated and quite horribleyou have a good sense of humor but youre being a bit pissy with your cons its a great piece of technology when your phone loses data stream mat not happen in europe but in the states it canyou have something on your headand its not hairid advice not to look at pornography in busy trafficright up to the point you said dampener you claim to be a grandad with a two year old phonewhats wrong with that so whats wrong the eons old word that has served us so well damper pleasewold be nice if it still was  pounds they arent anymoreive got this garmin and its an absolute piece of shit software wise its been designed by some old german grandfather who refuses to go beyond android  i usually search for the location of anything and then send it to the gps because the user interface is very s user unfriendly id saygarmin has been putting out absolute garbage for decadesthey put sgit out that is far from stablei have had to factory reset garmin devices literally scores of timesmy current pos zumo xt is stuck on japanese language zero way to change iti have done factory reset  timesabsolute  garbage companyi hate my garmin zumo its junk from the s yeezz that garmin is slowbetter than using your current phone is using an old phone your current phone stays in your pocket i use a samsung s specifically for motorcycle navigation spend your money on petrol and rideif you change your phone every  months damage from vibration should be a none issue gps companys will soon go bankrupttoo much information ie you tug yourself to bondage vids such a sad scene for a poorly shaven man

runner first marathon in  here i currently run with the forerunner   i am thinking about upgrading to the forerunner  mainly for the better battery lifestarted running a few months after turning  just turned  this month couldnt run a mile when i started now i run  days a week k most days and k  times a month had a hard time getting my miles up until i start following a lot of the advice from your channel over the past year thanks keep up the great workim addicted to these types of videos i spend hours and hours researching what i should buy and sometimes dont even buy what i wanted but the forerunner  has me checking prices constantly for the last  months seems like an amazing value just out of my budget robin here from belgium i started running about  years ago and have now signed up for my first ever marathon leiden  sinds starting ive taken on lots of advice from you guys at the running channel  so thanks for that im currently using the garmin forerunner  to track my runs and gym workouts and have never regretted investing in this watch thank you once again for all your advice and tipstricks regarding runningi got my first garmin watch earlier this year the forerunner  a definite upgrade on my fitbit and a game changer for my running also had the turquoise colour which ive received many compliments about so i have picked up running as a hobby last year i started with kms without any training  now i completed my  half marathons recently i am not part of any runners group or any training program i just watch running videos on youtube  feel inspired to push myself further i have signed up for my first full marathon in january tata mumbai marathon  i plan to prepare for it i believe any of the forerunner series will be a good fit for me to start with tracking my overall progress i am   my ultimate goal is to be fit throughout my life so that i can experience more adventures in lifecheers to all  the runners here i started running in my mind s and have used garmin watches for every step of my journey gradually upgrading as i got more experienced ive currently got a  which is brilliant the coaching suggestions and in app coaching has improved my running over the past year im going to tackle my first ultra next year so an upgrade to the fenix  pro or enduro would be a real confidence boostas a new runner  that has gotten into a hybrid athlete split i think that the forerunner  or the venu  or the vivo active  has more than enough features to elevate both my gym and body building workouts and run training not only will it help me make wise recovery decisions but also help me plan workouts wellfnix  user here its incredibly useful not only for running i also use it on my bikes as a head unit mounting it on the handlebars swim skiing everything as a triathlete doing races where navigation is sometimes needed it saves me from having to buy a separate gps only for the bike also for trail running you have a clear map so you never get lostbeen using the forerunner  for the last  years and would agree its perfect for someone beginning their running journey looking to upgrade now so thanks for this comprehensive overview of all the options would love the fenix  prorewatched last years video only last week thanks for the informative style of the video and impressed that you can remember all that information without having to pause all the timelove the running channel im definitely a beginner runner who does it to challenge myself without the expectation of ever being  the best at it id love a garmin i can grow into and i think the forerunner  would be more than enough for my needs having access to features like sleep tracking and body battery would be invaluable thank you all for everything you doim an apple watch user and ive been thinking of converting for a couple months now the forerunner  is gorgeous and i think the navigation feature would be seriously game changing for me because i hate planning routes the training guide also seems like such a cool feature def adding to my christmas list this yearas a new runner i never knew how amazing todays fitness watches are im really interested in the forerunner  as i really enjoy the data you can get from running the idea of having a wholistic view on how hard you should push yourself on your run is also really interesting to mealways good to listen to andy geeking out about tech im still using an entrylevel forerunner but the  does look so goodthe video is very well organized and easy to follow yet quick enough not feel like a drag great job very informative and well paced started running this year after losing kg and went from a min k to  k followinging the garmin coach k training plan and have been looking to upgrade my venu  to the forerunner  also great video as always love the channelnice job explaining the garmin product lines id describe garmin gps watch offerings as sprawling they have a huge choice in gps watches sizes bands and features and i can imagine a new customer being quite confused about which they should get i have a fenix  and id like to upgrade to the  pro for the flashlight its kind of a stupid reason to spend  but hey theres a sale this weekandy great roundup thanks for all the info and generally for the running channel i started running in lockdown at the age of  now at  im taking on my first half marathon in january and i have the running channel to thank for getting me out there in the first place giving me loads of advice along the way and for keeping me motivated i picked up a used forerunner xt which does the job but i love the look and features of the  as i think the training insights and guidance would really help me push on to the next level thanks to the whole teami switched from fitbit to the forerunner  at the beginning of the year and absolutely no regrets im currently using the garmin coach to help train for a half marathon i would love to upgrade to the forerunner s with music not taking my phone would be amazing great video andystarted running in about april this year and had no intention of doing anything longer than kmonly started for the fitness snd health benefits of being activesooo long story short im considerimg doing my first ever marathon on the nd of december wish me luckgreat video couldnt quite decide on what watch i maybe need in my life before rhis video using a polar  that dies at about km in would love the venu  for cross training alsoi would definitely go for the forerunner  i think with a super accurate gps and features like training readiness its a watch that will both help track runs really well but also help me make better workout decisionsjust started running and i didnt realise how much was involved in it from specialist running shoes to watches  i have to admit the forerunner  looks brilliant with all the extra fixtures like the suggested workout features that will help towards my running goals just will have to ask santa for it  cant wait for the next video the running channel release and keep up the good workthanks for the informative video i have always wanted a gps watch but get so overwhelmed with the options i have been running with my phone but im in canada and the cold weather kills battery power and has failed me on several runs a forerunner s would be my dream phone i really loved seeing toms journey i replay his video whenever i feel uninspired to gear up and it gives me the boost i need thank you for being so vulnerable and letting us in on your journey tom when im feeling good i cruise to andys videos and imagine myself looking as effortless as he does as a new runner all of these options were slightly overwhelming but its so cool learning about all the technology out there for runners and athletes of all kinds as someone who gets lost just trying to navigate the trails of a park thats only about  sq miles any watch with gps navigation sounds like a dream will definitely check out that video that covers all of the garmin watch specs to learn more about the forerunner series optionsi would definitely go for the  or epix pro just to experience the amoled screens ive really been eyeing something with navigation and maps when i go on trail runs or newer areas around me love that garmin has so many optionsgreat video looking to start training for longer ultras these garmin watches will definitely be a must have along the way keep up the cool worki love my venu plus which has helped get me back running regularly this year but i would love to upgrade to a forerunner  for those advanced stats mapping and suggested workouts love the rc content as always keep knocking it out of the park guysive been using the  for a few years at this point and it has served me well in improving my pacerunning fitness id love to upgrade to the newer versions with the  or  even to step up my triathlon trainingthank you andy you explained the different models in a very concise and easy to understand way i recently purchased the  using it has improved my fitness and has taken me from no running to km in  weeks age thank you andy for the thorough explanation of the features they offer all of them are so nice the forerunner  is soooo beautiful it would be such a big motivator to head out there and run keep on rockingnew runner here at  years old just started running a couple of months a go and caught the bug binge watching this channel certainly has given me more then enough information to get me hooked and give me good running knowledge havent got a watch yet and never had one so ive started out running without worrying to much about all the data  although  months into my journey already and i think a fenix  pro would certainly get me up to speed in hitting k at correct pace without me coming up short all the time at k because mentally i think i have finished hahaha love the channel and love running enjoy everyonei am a  year old girl who just graduated college i was a division  rower and collegiate soccer player so after graduating i decided to get into running to keep up my fitness its been a great hobby and i also get to run with my dad which has been great for bonding we have done a couple halfs and have our first full marathon in february i have only had an apple watch  and want to increase my fitness and running so i think the forerunner  would be great especially for the battery longevity and multi sport as i also want to get into triathlons i have a smaller wrist so i think the  would be too big but that would be my top choiceabout  months ago i started running after always having said that running was nothing for me it is by far the most accessible way of working out and im really happy i started at the beginning i got a second hand vivoactive  but now that ive seen the light i would really like to make a big upgrade to the forerunner  maybe ill even sign up for a marathonalso the running channel has really helped me to get motivated to get this far and im really grateful for it thanks everyonestarted running this summer with a  mile race in mind which went great and it got me so hooked that ill be running my first marathon next year in copenhagen with my km weekly mileage something like the garmin forerunner  or  seems ideal to get me ready help me plan my training and resting and prevent serious injuriesforerunner  did my first half marathon this year with my partner and loved it having a watch would be so helpful to train for another one next yearthanks andy thats a great breakdown of the different watches ive been a fan of garmin for decades and currently have a fenix  because of the open water swimming tracking i used during triathlon training there are some super cool new features i would love to get my hands on and would love a standard sized epix pro gen  sapphire talk about next level  well done on the marathon this year im signed up for berlin in  so ive been watching all the running channel marathon related videos keep up the great workthank you for this  super helpful i have a venu st series and its been a great introduction into a sports watch im now looking to upgrade to a more running specific watch and i think the forerunner s seems perfect for me but i would also love a fenix if given the chance whilst it wasnt mentioned today i definitely appreciated the previous short i think sarah did explaining some of the garmin safety features as a female runner they have given me extra confidence and comfort to get out especially in dark winter runs  so thanks all this is a great video to drop the day before black friday with so much technical data on all the watches its easy to get a bit blinded this cuts right through it all ive been debating updating my forerunner  to a  for the mapping feature traveling for work i often find myself constantly checking my phone for my running route this confirms im in the  camp just debating how much i need the pretty screen of the great video as always guys super thoroughim  and returning to running after spinal surgery a few years ago id love to get my hands on the forerunner  to help track my trainingi have just finished my first k race and am about to start my half marathon training in  weeks a garmin would be a great addition to my training i have had my eyes on the forerunner  for months but havent taken the plunge yet thank you for clarifying that the  is the perfect watch for me it been a year now since i have taken running seriously and i must say garmin has really helped me achieve my running goals and not to mention the running channel is phenomenal in helping amateur runners like me with all your informative and inspiring content amongst all forerunner  is my favouritethank you for providing us with a great overview of the choicesjust moved back to the states and found your videos super helpful in finding the right garmin for myself to tackle trails and all my activities  thank you for your timeenjoy following your journey to the marathon ive finished a  week program for the halfmarathon and just ended the first week of my  week program for the marathon a forerunner  would go great with the rest of the program all the best on your progressgreat work andy this really helps lay out the differences and shows what sort of runner each of these is catered towards as a forerunner  user im considering upgrading to take my running training up a level after watching this i feel like the forerunner  would be the one for me would love to have my music on my watch so i dont have to take my phone with me and i love the amoled screenthanks andy for the video it reignited my wish to upgrade from my fr to fr the fr has been a motivation to start running again during covid and now aiming to run a full marathon in  all the best for valenciaafter watching your marathon training videos andy really got me interested in the forerunner  features

see how much theyve moved on in such a short time so might be time to upgrade the  looks amazingi thoroughly enjoyed this video it was a quick and easy to follow guide that was really helpful im fairly new to running as well about  months now but i absolutely love this community the forerunner   looks like an exceptional watch anything from garmin is really that would really motivate me to completing my first half marathonstarted running earlier this year after binge watching all the videos on your channel now i usually either listen to the pod cast every saturday while walking to our local park run yep its walking distance from my house how lucky or as of recent while shacked up with a sprained ankle  loving the info i get from my  and its features but really missing the mapping ability and keep forgetting to download my routes from the planner when i go away si started with the forrunner  upgraded to the fenix  pro solar sapphire but have been looking at the enduro watch as

looks like the perfect intro and would help so much with beginning my running journeyi was a mm sprinter when i was young  sad violin in the background   stopped due to various health issues that made me slower didnt even run since i was devastated by it i have recently started running longer distances after  years of not really exercising regularly and it have helped me massively to improve my mental and physical health  as well as finally getting over the fact that i am not going to be an elite athlete and its fine  i am loving running again and that is what is important currently i am running while holding my smartphone and tracking everything on strava from splits  to hills  to k long runs i could use a forerunner insert whatever number here to help dont mind the amoled screen or the music even though that would be super cool the entry level  seems to have most of the features needed to compete from k to k ultramarathonscurrently running with a garmin  but would love  to upgrade to a garmin  and then my daughter could have my  good luck with your marathon andy you will smash itthanks for the great video andy with all the watches out there it can be very confusing as

to see the new lineups i picked up a  a couple years ago as that was and still is all i could afford to go for  if i had the money i would probably upgrade to a forerunner  so that gets my vote  the  screen looks nice but as a teacher at elementary schools i imagine the kids would want to mess with it too much if it looked that nicegreat explanation hoping to get the forerunner s this christmasbrilliant video and really useful  my s has done well over the last  years but i now want to upgrade it to one of the  forerunner watches just the other day i was watching your video from

incredible i would love to have a watch a garmin to see all the stats any to train with itsuper informative video  because i run hike and do both strength and hiit workouts ive always coveted the

thanks andy i currently wear a fenix  its been brilliant love the range of metrics and battery life with more ultra events on my horizon for  a fenix  would be a nice upgrade though the impressive

vivoactive  but would love to upgrade to a forerunner great video would definitely be the epix for meive been an avid hiker for some years and the garmin instinct x solar watch would be the perfect companion for my adventures with its rugged construction long battery life and comprehensive fitness tracking features i know this watch would help me take my outdoor experiences to the next levellove

always used an apple watch but im definitely very tempted by a garmin i love the pacepro and body battery features i think id use them lots and it would be so much easier using pacepro than trying to

infogreat content as always andy i started running  nearly  years ago and would love the garmin epix pro gen  to compliment my running thanks andy for the comprehensive review i purchased my first

rickfantastic and comprehensive review garmin have more watches than i realized my first and only gps watch has been the forerunner  for the last few years and it is still great for what i need most

over the last year i could see it keeping me happy for a very long timefantastic video thanks for the insights im particularly drawn to the garmin epix gen  for its blend of style and functionality as someone passionate about fitness this watch seems like the perfect companion for both my workouts and daily life been looking for ages at garmin so many choices thank u for breaking them all down id def go for forerunner  my trusty fitbit is not cutting now im deep in marathon traininggreat video been rocking the fenix  pro for a while great watch but if i had to choose again fenix  solar would be my choice for those long training weeks keep up the great workthis was an excellent video comparing all of the garmin watches i was undecided which model is the right one for me i now believe that the forerunner  is the one that will fit my exercise routine thanks for all the informationnice video very clear i like the running channel very muchi started using the forerunner  about  months ago and it pushed my motivation for running i am struggling with the push buttons though as they tend to get stuck every now and then it is already the second replacement therefore i would love to upgrade to the forerunner  in the hope of better buttons and a boost with the race widget the forecast of the suggested workouts and the animated workoutsamazing video interesting information shame that never been mentioned forerunner  amazing watch and has everything you need i have this watch for over yrs never disappointed great video gotta be the  now ive got a few road marathons under my belt the trails beckon maybe even an ultra i absolutely love my forerunner  looks like the  and  are nice upgrades especially the bright screen on the awesome breakdown of the garmin watches not knowing much about any of them this is super helpful im leaning towards the fenix  pro sapphire thanks for the helpi would choose the forerunner  personally i have been lost in the forests far too many times and always wished i had something better than my phone i also regret not having better statistics for when i spent months hiking every day cheerslove this kind of videos  nive to have all those details about the differents models  as for me id totally go for the fenix  pro there are so many watches i dont have a running watch right now and i think the forerunner  would be great for my runs i do parkrun a lot and think this would help me get a pb i watch all your videos and listen to the podcastive been a track athlete for  years and started running longer distances a couple of years ago currently have a fenix s pro but love the features of the forerunner  and fenix super informative video since i dont have a watch the forerunner  sounds like a dream i mean i do like the challenge of trying to do a speed or tempo run using my phone but the suggestive workouts and pacing feature also seem nice thank you for all the amazing contentin  my friend got me into running my first race was with him doing a half which was tough he then convinced me on my nd race which was a k race  since then i have loved ultra running and done a few more ks with this i would love to have a watch that can handle this and also future  milers the enduro pro would be perfectim a teen and cant wait for begin my training for some upcoming races didnt like using my dads old apple watch and cant wait for a refresh but might have to wait a while i think the forerunner  music would probably be my favourite out of all because of the sick features and the fact you can play music from the watch which i think is so cool as well as suggested workouts on top hopefully will be able to smash out some pbs with a new watch sometime see you on the trails runnersi ran my first ever marathon a few months ago and im really happy that i got threw it without any problem im rocking a garmin forerunner  but looking to upgrade to a bigger one preferably to one whit navigation therefore the  would be my watch of choicei currently have the venu sq and although it is good for most things there are definitely improvements that could be made for me i was looking at the vivoactive  just because its similar in what it offers but after seeing the others im not sure  probably the forerunner  gotta love those buttonsgreat video as always been running with huawei smart watch for the last year and its been good but looking at the forerunner  and its vast features makes it really tempting to gear uphello i have the  model now and ive enjoyed it  i would like  the  of even   i run on roads and trails love the channel thanks great video pulling the trigger on the forerunner  would be awesome to have an epix pro but to expensive for me thanks for all the comparisonsthank you for the video its the first time ive seen all the garmin contenders shown off and explained in one place the choice is clear enduro i have been using a garmin  without music for almost  years and im thinking of buying a garmin  because in my opinion its the best option for mid experienced runner with a good balance of features and battery i feel the best option for trainingrunning marathons i hope i have a chance of winning onethanks for the video it helped me a lot to understand all different garmin flavourshad my fr for a couple of years would love to have something like the  for the mapping capabilities great review andy i am rather a very late starter  to running really looking towards the instinct x range the simplicity and battery life really appeal to me very wellso far clocking my time on a simple casioi have had a forerunner  for my first few years of running im contemplating the plunge to a fenix s as i have lots of trail ultras coming up the extra features such as maps will be really very usefulive started my running adventures with a forerunner  but after that video the forerunner  looks very appealing as the next step upi do triathlon and currently own a forerunner  i am thinking of upgrading to the  with the amazing screen and improved featuresgreat video been running with the fnix for a while now but want to switch to the forerunner the amoled is unrealwell done video just started running this summer and using a handed down vivoactive   would love to upgrade to the workouts and mapping features of the great video as always i use my venu to track everything run gym bike and also some rugby when it doesnt has contact would love something more rugged and durable as the enduroreally helpful video ready to upgrade from my apple watch to something like the forerunner this is the video i needed thank you for the deep dive on all the options im using the vivoactive  at the moment which does the job but would like to have access to more advanced running features of the watches in the  forerunner series i think  might be the right for megreat video lays out all of the differences and features the forerunner  would be a great upgrade the fullfeatured maps are great for navigationgreat garmin watch comparison very helpful i would really like a top end forerunner or fenix theyre all superb tbh keep up the videos and merry christmas regards grahamvery informative video  i currently have the forerunner  would love to upgrade to the awesome breakdown of the very extensive garmin lineup of watches while the fnix  has always caught my eye for its abundant features and smaller s version i think the s would be a great watch for me the in built coaching and newer health metrics would help me to get more consistent and progressive as a runner rather than relying on my own haphazard plansmy forerunner m has been a great buddy last few years across km running journey if im have to pick one that would be  for sure for the premium built and fantastic amoled display and great battery lifei am branching into tri this year and currently have a m the ability to switch from swimming to cycling to running at the touch of a button will be very useful and ideally i would be getting myself a frill be hiking the pct next year and have been dabbling with trail running for the first time id love to set an eventual goal of doing ultras but for now i think the epix gen x would be best suited for a  mile hike from mexico to canada so as of now thats the one id choose thanks for the infohaving had the garmin forerunner xt for the last few years im looking to upgrade to the garmin  or  to record all my running and other random sporting fun activities training for rome marathon in march and  ultras in may my watch definetly gets a lot of actionthanks for the video andy that was really helpful identifying the main differences among all these garmin watches the variety is huge personally i find the instinct  series really nice for people doing many different sports and enjoy outdoor activities especially the solar ones if you live in sunny places like myselfi started runningjogging before covid but nothing serious and then during lockdown decided i need to up my game worked out a route on google maps checked the time i left home and got back on my phone and thats how i measured my runs eventually bought a forerunner  and that upped my running also got one for my wiferecently upgraded to the  and what a difference hr monitor a lot more accurate and so much faster cant imagine how the top of the line watches will perform i will probably look at something like the fenix  when i upgrade eventually by that time there will probably be a fenix  hahathank you for an exceptional video explaining the difference between the garmin watches my dream watch is definitely the  but it will probably take me a few years to save up for thati currently have the vivoactive  but the battery life is starting to wain and i have a bit of feature envy for the  with solar charging great video thanks for the hard worki recently did my very first half marathon i enjoyed it very much and it made me decide to start training to do a full marathon in a couple of months in order to do a good training and do long runs without getting lost it would be handy to have a watch like the forerunner  with its detailed mapsthank you for producing this video i have the enduro v and i have been extremely happy with the battery life i have been thinking about upgrading but i might still have to wait i am tempted to go fenix with the battery that will last  hr on gps as i will not have to charge on events otherwise back to endure will see thank you for sharingthanks for the explanation id love one of the forerunners great video thanksas a runner who is looking to run the first marathon i would like the forerunner  thank u for the video and i wish everyone good luckbrilliant video so informative i have recently ran my first ever k at victoria park managed it in h  mins and even got my mug in a picture going over the finish line i have definitely caught the running bug and just treated myself to a proper pair of running shoes if i am lucky enough to win one i would love the  mm but then if i am honest anyone of them beats my little casio set my self a goal of running a half marathon befor i hit  so i have year to get training amazing channel you all do brilliant stuff and make content for all types of runners i currently own forerunner and it has changed my life and health hugely since the purchase i have done a half marathon and signed up for my first full marathon in april  i love that the watch can keep motivating me everyday forerunner would be a fantastic upgrade as i love this map feature mapping for a run especially a long run has always been a bit difficult part of my trainings i would be thrilled if i will be able to own this super watchthe forerunner  would be the ideal running watch for me  i think preplanning of variable routes and training plans would help take me to the next level whilst keeping the necessary longer battery and loading up my music as a running companion thanks for showing us the range of watches available ive been eyeing the epix pro for awhile i hike has much as i rungood stuffenduro  thank you garminlove the running channeli have had a garmin xt for  years and absolutely love it i may upgrade at some point but i recommend getting a garmin its well worth itgreat video explaining all the garmin watches currently have an fr  music and its great interested in the  for the added metrics and amoled screengreat vid  i like the runner  another great videoi was really stuck between the forerunner  and fenix  pro but this has really helped going with the forerunner  hopefully i would love the forerunner   that looks amazing  i still have  x forerunner  because i love the splitscreen in to  measurements and i love the training partner feature where i can race myself    years and i have never stopped using themi would love to upgrade to garmin forerunner  your review of this watch really resonated with me great video i have the forerunner  its a great watch would love the  with the extra features but its expensiveintresting platform to share my running journey i never ran before in my life but somehow i stumbled upon love for treking the himalayas and for that i had to be fit it became motivation to run and soon i started participating in runs and started enjoying it from k on jan  to k on oct  and currently prepping for full marathon i would have never thought i could do this that too in such short span somewhere in between i got forerunner  and it has been amazing its so feature loaded that im still finding some new features every other day but given a chance to win a garmin watch i would love garmin epix pro as it would be perfect for both running and treking the himalayas  btw have been to two week long trek of himalayas till now and hoping for many moreive recently bought a second hand fenix s for the triathlon and open water swimming mode i love it if i were to get a new one id choose one with better map functionality rather than just a breadcrumb trail like this one currently have the  music lovely watch and great for uploading podcasts for my sunday long runhave had my eye on the  though for a little while i love my forerunner  music but i have been looking to update it the forerunner  looks to be next thanks for a great review of the current garmin offeringsi just started running abort six months ago and to my surprise i completely fell in love with it im currently using my apple watch for all of my runs but would love something with a better battery life and some more running statistics so i would love an upgrade to the forerunner  as always great video i absolutely love your channeli started running  months ago and it has changed my life for the better before i was always working out but i was unhappy with my condition even though i was fit i always felt something was off  months before i started running i took a rest from working out and lost significant amount of muscle when i was ready to get back i wanted something more challenging so i said why not run within weeks i lost  kilos all my clothes started being large on me and the smaller size clothes i was keeping but not wearing in my closet became perfect size first time i started running i could barely run for  minutes  months in and  hour runs with  pace doesnt even bother me currently im just below  k and my goal is to get sub  soon and have enough endurance to run a half marathon  dream watch forerunner  would get me through everything i needas someone who loves outdoor activities i am drawn to the fenix or epix line i love the idea that i will have a backup gps during my hike as it is colder now in hk looking forward tl doing more hikes however i am a member of the small wrist club so i guess fenix s sapphire solar would be my choicestarted running after a horrible atv accident in  i really enjoy the sport and i belong to a running club ive used the garmin products my whole running career so i know how reliable they are i currently own a venue but would like to upgrade to the forerunner line maybe a  or exactly what i needed as im currently due a new watch ive had the fenix before and cannot fault iti currently have the forerunner  music but now im setting my sights on running ultra distances on trails the fenix seems like the perfect matchthe  sounds amazing id love to try one i also like your funky yellow strap great job full info about garmin smartwatches  could be nice to have garmin forerunner i have a forerunner  the  looks amazing great review andy in whay is such a complexed feild for me as a trail runner mocing into ultras it has to be the enduro  especially because of the mapping features keep up the great workthank you for the update  would be goodi started with started with the vivoactive  from and apple watch and it sold me into the eco system then i upgraded to a  for a year and loved it then when i saw the instinct x solar come out i was interested and traded in my forerunner for it i have had that since june and i love it i miss mapping but i never used it really so its more me wanting the bells and whistles but the instinct is more accurate on hr and distance than any of my previous watchesim itching to try the round trip feature on the forerunner   this sounds like a perfect way to explore new places when i travel for workexcellent informative video id love to try out the forerunner  good workplain and simple forerunner good walk through andy ill be saving and reviewing again when it comes time to replace my fr i am looking at extending my running to ultra distance next year and would love the enduro watch but  might dictate otherwisei have been running for around  years now and would love to get more involved in trail and ultra running i currently use my mums garmin forerunner  which has taken me through a marathon and i have been so impressed by how long it has lasted i would love to upgrade to a fenix  s for the mapping features and all of the data analytics as i am a little bit obsessed with analysing my runs and i would really like to prioritise battery life i have been sold by this videothe newer fenix has so many more features over my ancient  fenix s the general feature upgrade is very tempting but might be hard to justify but thanks for the run down it really highlights the software upgrades even between the same series of watches i do love my watch but it could be even betterfairly new runner here and i love my forerunner   but i like that the  has more details on running up hills and living in devon that would be really useful  thanks for the great videoi really like the look of the forerunner   my eyesight isnt great in dim light  at this time of year with the dark mornings and evenings i really struggle to get motivated to go out and run  i think that beautiful bright screen could really be a game changer for me   great video  thank youi am eyeing the forerunner  finally shifting from an apple watch to the garmin family first marathon on sunday and i wish i already had the garmin metrics working for megetting into ultra running this year looking at fenix  solar sapphire or the  for their mapping capabilities along with the battery life both look an amazing bits of kitreally insightful video thank you my vivoactive s has served me well on my beginner running journey but im starting to venture now into longer distances i think an uprgade to the garmin forerunner s would really help me on my journey i also really love the amoled displayamazing video awesome details about the full watch range been running for about  months absolutely addicted and currently have the forerunner  amazing watch and has helped me loads must admit the forerunner  is a beauty and would love to upgrade to that soon  love the map feature and the possibility to have music without bringing my phonethank you for this thorough review i purchased a forerunner  a while ago replacing a  and would love to have the map features available with the forerunner  not to mention the staminaendurance measurementsa great video andy and certainly answered the questions of which watch suits  i currently use a forerunner  music and it coached me through my first k and currently working towards my first half marathon in januarythe forerunner  is the one id like to move up to but feel like i need to earn it maybe when i get a  hour half that will be the present to myself  the fnix  pro looks amazing but massively overkill for what id use it forgot myself a forerunner  but its starting to glitch so having a new watch ready to start my marathon training would be great and also would be a nice early christmas present from what i call the best running channel ive watched plenty of advice and recommendations ive told others about the running channel and theyve told others also so a new watch would be great maybe the forerunner  or  would be amazing  not pink though great video i would like to upgrade from my  now as ive moved on to ultra distances and will be tackling uts next year the fenix  pro seems to have all the features i would ever needreally comprehensive video with lots of detailed information right now i use a forerunner  but would like to upgrade to a fenix  pro sapphire solar thanks for the superb video for such a dizzying and impressive range im really starting to step up my journey into trail running and the fenix  pro regular size would be the most amazing unobtainium support as i push my efforts on the trails   i was gifted a s and loved it so managed to persuade santa to get me a   im about to start training for my first proper half marathon and would love a  as im toying with multisport events toothe  with all its features would be so helpful with my training im hoping to do a marathon next year and having a watch with all the help of a running coach is my ideal coachgarmin forerunner  has been amazing after getting into running a year ago does everything a new runner needscool video i am using a forerunner  and are pretty on fire with the i was hoping so hard for this video been watching the old one but missed to many models to make a choicei was looking for a video like this forever thanks for making it i would love to win the enduro ive been using the forerunner  for  years now and ive been really happy with it forerunner  would be a great step upthis has been a year of growing possibilities in my active life and i now have my first  hour run success it would be great to say that my active life required the battery life and multitude of options provided in the epix pro or even the enduro  maybe someday for now the forerunner  solar for the stamina feature navigation and gps battery life provide what is right for me nowgreat video viewers will get comprehensive understanding of garmin watches by watching this videohave been using the forerunner  with great pleasure now im thinking about upgrading to fenix  or epix  a couple more nice features and a waterproof watch will make outdoor challenges easier and even more funi have a fenix s saphire and i love it  it is the ideal guide on long bike rides and provides useful insights for running and triathlon its however unfortunate that garmin doesnt include the new software features with the updatesmy dream watch would be the epix pro  with its stunning amoled screenas someone new to watches and running im someone who loves tactical gear and intense training so the instinct  solar would be a dream to wingreat summary of all available watches especially with all the different models id really like the epix probeen eyeing up the forerunner  for a while love my instinct   navigation is its only let down when im out in the wild great video summarizing their product line  with that many watches to choose from it can be a hard decision to make i think i would go for the epix pro very interesting im the proud owner of the garmin  and its got me through quite a few marathons id definitely be interested in an upgrade the  looks fantasticmaybe its finally time to switch from coros to garmin i would love to upgrade to the garmin forerunner  or  awesome videogreat video i currently have a fenix  but would love the fenix  or even the the  has been amazing for me nice jump up from the  but im sure the newer features are pulling me in especially the s screenvery good summary of all the options garmin has to offer thank youusing a  presently but ive been dreaming of a   training for my first marathon next year and so so excited for iti recently lost my coros pace  while swimming in a particularly wavy sea i bought that watch to see if i would enjoy running as a way to stay in shape it was a good purchase and motivated me to go out and run  times a week now that ive lost it im looking at replacing it with a watch from the epix series i would definitely enjoy the more rugged build quality and a bigger screen cant hurt my fiance has a venus and the suggested workout feature is pretty cool as well so if i would win i think i would go for an epix pro  mmgreat review im training for my first marathon like you the forerunner  would be perfect for my training too would be perfect to help me train for my first marathon the navigation will make it easier to explore new routes whilst doing my long runs in london its so easy to get stuck in rut doing the same km run i feel this watch will help me shake it up thank youi currently wear a garmin forerunner  love this watchgps is fantastic epics pro would probably be my next watch from garminor if they come out with a forerunner  thanks thanks for your hard workthe forerunner  would be amazing for xmas   keep up the great contentnewer runner started in may the forerunner  looks amazinghoping to run my first marathon in  ill be picking up a garmin to help me get there eyeing either the forerunner  or venu i currently use a fenix x pro having moved from my apple watch se due to poor battery life on my long runs  i love the fact i a tonne of battery life and can pair my shokz open run headphones and listen to spotify playlists on my long runs  i turn  next month and have entered my first ultras next year rttk in june and rtts in july  one of the main reasons for switching to the fenix and of course the multitude of data points captured to help monitor training progress  i am seriously considering the epix for the fantastic screen especially on these dark morning training runsvery interesting review the s are definitely on my list for xmasnice vid andy i had a  for years but got fed up with the bemused looks of younger runners so upgraded to a  which is dead easy to use and live with battery life no problem for marathons but looking to do the saintlyon next year so maybe looking to upgrade hesitantly shame theres no marathon plans on garmin connect  fenix pro is definitely my favourite not that bothered by the amoled screen but being able to map skiing swimming gym and hiking etc and that amazing battery lifethis is the video i have been needing i have been looking to upgrade my garmin but i have been unsure of which one is for me the forerunner  has all that i would want as i am looking to pace myself to new pbs and would love to try new routes on my runs with the map featureid love the epix currently got an instinct so this would be a massive upgrade i love the amoled display  but also love the practical features of pacepro to really take my runs to the next level and i have tiny wrists the epix  forerunner  or decisions decisions great videoreally helpful video great explanations im currently using a forerunner  i think out of the all i liked the forerunner  solar or the  the best currently use a fr for running and sleephrv tracking but still rely on my faithful instinct solar when doing gardening and diy  pairing the fr with the hrmpro seems to give me all the data and accuracy ill ever needi completed my first half marathon this past october and i am currently training for a full marathon by next fall  the fenix  pro would be my watch of choiceive been using the fenix hr since it came on the market and its done the job for all my cycling and running needs but ready to upgrade to the fenix x pro sapphiregreat guide really interesting video my trusty forerunner  has served me well over the years but i would really love some of the training features that the newer watches now offer that forerunner  looks great and would really help me at next years loch ness marathonnice video thanks im  and have been running since my school years but i got serious about it and began tracking my progress and mileage during the corona pandemic i used to have a fenix  but it stopped working a year ago so i switched to apple however i find myself missing the suggestions and metrics that garmin provided im now dreaming of switching back and im particularly interested in the epix progreat video im using a fenix x plus at the moment never had a new garmin watch always bought them second hand great watches overall im looking at fenix x progreat video forerunner  would be awesome for me im always struggling to plan out a running route around my area without holding my phone and frequently checking the maphave been eyeing up the  and  for monthscurrently using the xt but cant decide between the venu  and fenix  as an upgrade informative video and more to think about nowhi nice vidi started a month ago training for my first triathlon race and looking to upgrade my samsung smartwatch with a  or a fenix  those are some orgeous watchesvery good and informative video thank you im coming back to running after a decade of laziness using the forerunner  and very happy with it but miss amoled displaysi started running this year after looseing kg weight and so far i dont have a good running watch but i love the gadgets and looks of the fenix s hopefully this will be my first garmin watch for getting better in running loved the videowould love to get the forerunner  currently run with my phone but the accuracy of the  and the additional features like training readiness and running power make it the perfect option for me i also like that theres such a big range of activities to select fromgreat overview thanks andy as an ultratrailrunners member i would go with epix pro gen great video andy its bonkers how many garmin watches there are isnt itid love the epix pro gen  mm please good luck with the traininggreat overview andy would love to own the epics pro no but choosing a watch is soo overwhelming for my last birthday i decided to get myself new running shoes and a watch that was in september and i still havent bought the watch  also the round trip routing feature is really cool no need to spend time planning routes in strava anymore i would definintely trust andy and choose the watch hes usingi started with a forerunner  then went to the fenix range i currently have a fenix  but epix range sounds great especially with the solar featurei have been a jogger for the last couple of years and used the forerunner  but as the battery life slowly begins to dwindle and i discover the joys of triathlon i would love to upgrade to the forerunner  great video andy it is the best summary of garmin watches i have seen i would like the white venu s or the vivoactive  for my girlfriend i already own a first generation fenix  and it does the job really well thank youthe forerunner  looks like an amazing watch have been a fan of the fenix series for a number of years now currently i have the fenix s and its serving me well the main thing i wish it had is full mapping capabilities i really like that it comes in a smaller size for my tiny wristsexcellent review very informative i think the epix pro is the best choice for mei would love a forerunner  that screen looks amazing currently using the forerunner  but with my first marathon in april an upgrade might be duei have the  right now its old but for sure the forerunner  is my dream end game watchthe fenix for sure i have an old vivoactive that i would love to upgradeim a marathon runner and i would looove the epix pro saphire mm thanks for your amazing videosgreat video im a runner only and ended up grabbing the instinct  solar on sale i love it i was tired of my apple watchs amoled screen that turned on and off all the time the instinct  pretty much just looks like a normal watch with the monochrome displaycurrently training for a spring marathon with my fr looking at upgrading to the s in the future i really like the new amoled screenreally useful video i desperately want to upgrade to the fenix  so thatd definitely be my choice kept looking hopefully at the black fridays deals but sadly so far out of my budget still  so fingers crossedgreat informative video  i currently use a fenix  pro which is a fantastic watch very interesting though seeing how the tech has advanced in such a short timereally handy video as im looking to upgrade from my existing watch swaying towards the fenix  pro after watching this video given the relatively small increase in cost vs forerunner running with the forerunner  and more than happy but if you are offering a chance  to upgrade  then the forerunner  looks amazing great video showing all the differences in the watchesstarted off with a second hand forerunner  but thinking of upgrading would love to try the epix on my newfound love for trailslove the content you guys put out have been a pretty standard runner using a basic fitbit tracker for a while up until now i have recently become more serious with running as my main form of exercise and wanting to upgrade to a garmin it will help give me analytics to help improve my run times and keep me on track as i have signed to a half marathon next year i have watched a lot of your content of both the  and the epix pro gen  you guys make both sound sound really attractive i dont know what one to pick i would love to win the giveaway for either of those watches so you can make the decision for me haha keep up the good work allgreat video i would probably go for the fr for nowthe forerunner s looks great for me as i am beginning my training for the manchester marathon i have entered for the last  years but keep getting injured before it so hopefully it is rd time luckyim currently still running without a sports watch just use my phone with stopwatch but that forerunner series is starting to look more and more appealing the more i seehear of it hahai started running properly for the first time this year at  after running a company k and getting hooked running a couple of half marathons and signing up for a full marathon in april next year ive had apple watches for years as my fitness tracker but have been looking for something a bit more recently and would love the epic pro to transition over to garminthis very was very informative after this review im leaning towards the enduro i would love the  for my upcoming marathon will be my first one years ago i was doing my research on which garmin watch id want to buy since i was really into running and would like to improve my runs i ran at km on short runs and was finally dipping my toes in trying out a half marathon then the pandemic happenednow im slowly pacing myself to get back to my old pr if i can without injuring myself forerunner  would be great to get me back on my feet again and be consistent enough to run my first half marathon and reach minkm againgreat video really helpful my first garmin was a fenix s i loved that watch but its getting long in the tooth now and technology has moved on but i still really like the appearance and functions of the fenix and epix watches as a runner in my late s i would love to have the epix pro gen  for the amoled screen to help my old lady eyes see my stats clearly when im running cant wear reading glasses to run or id fall overgreat video with very useful insights im running now for  months and run a half marathon under u next up is training for my first marathon just like you and hope a new watch will help me achieve my goal i have an old  and im interested in a forerunner  or the epix not sure which would be the best for megood stuff been a fan of the fr  for years i would like to get an enduro  soon the fr  cant keep up with me on my h ultra runs great video my fav has to be the forerunner  my garmin instinct was great but its nearing its end battery lasts maybe a day now id love to upgrade to the garmin enduro  it sounds awesomegreat video i have a phoenix x pro sapphire great watch it so good my wife and kids got garmin watches i would go for the epic pro solar  sapphire full size when i replace minei would go with the fenix s pro since where i live in sweden its almost always dark in the winter sp the flashlight would be great as a safety feature when running i also love the fact that it isnt massive like most garmin watchesi would love the fenix  training for my first marathon next year and the tools it offers would be invaluablei love the forerunner range and love my  i have always donated my old garmins that i upgrade to newer runners because i know the difference having a good watch can make but also that its a big expense early on id love to upgrade to the  from my  mainly for the added navigation and mapping capabilities i use the navigation i have a lot but would like to have the clearer maps when exploring new placesthe mapping feature of the forerunner  and  is definitely the biggest sell for me i currently have the  and have been using garmin coach to train for for a k and is currently training for a kjust turned  today and have been running for a little over a year now  i have been using my apple watch up to this point but would love a garmin watch  the forerunner  or  would be amazingthanks for the video as a runner i really like what the forerunner  provides however i do like the features of the epix pro and how itll look for my casual professional life for everyday wearive just started my running journey and have goal set a half marathon for next autumn and a marathon in  i blame the running channel for these goals affectionately of course id love to add garmins help to my training to keep me on trackgreat overview who knew there were so many garmin watches  with that screen it would have to be the epix pro for megreat insight to the differences of all the modelsive always been eyeing up the fenix s  the sheer volume of multisport options for my other pursuits to running like rock climbing etc just make it such a complete package and the sizing of the s watch would fit a lot better on my small wristsi have been using the enduro  for the past  months since stepping up to ultra distance races and it has never let me down the battery life is amazing and its surprising just how useful the flashlight is the only downside is the screen brightness which could be better however i guess that this would compromise battery lifei bought the forerunner  a year ago as a basic tracker when i trained for a half marathon last year debating doing a full marathon next year so potentially looking to upgrade to a  or great videoi would like to see a video on the  using navigation and the routes features in actual practicei currently use the forerunner  thinking of upgrading to that sweet oled displayvery helpful video thanks  my forerunner  is over  years old so definitely getting time to upgrade  maybe a   wondering about garmin pay too if i can leave the phone at homei think that a garmin  would be the perfect choice for me all the features that i need and that amoled screen looks amazing i would go for the forerunner  it really looks amazing the features and capabilities are very nicedidnt realise how many watches garmin actually hadmy favourite would be the fenix  since i do quite a few different outdoor sports and would love the battery life for going campingive been running with my amazfit smart bracelet and later smartwatch both of which came with my phone but ive been meaning to upgrade to an actual running watch for sometime now hope i get the chance to play around with that forerunner s great video once again been a fan of garmin for a while great job going through the range  had my eye on the epix pro gen  mm for a while  i will take the plunge one day great video forerunner  would be my ideal watch with its big bright screen and all the capabilities of the bigger heavier fenix and epix watches if you have one going i would love to help out came back to running after years of despair due to trauma and circumstances and really think i would love to have that forerunner  to assist in my training for half marathon and maybe even marathonthank

winwhat a great range of watches im on my rd garmin having started with forerunner xt then xt and now using the fenix  maybe its time for an upgrade i have my eye on the forerunner  for sure the forerunner  is gorgeous that would be my choice have come back to my old garmin fenix after exploring what apple had to offer the mileage battery life and practicalities cant be beat imo i also use their dive series for scuba diving which performs really well would love to experience the running series as im transitioning into running longer distances marathon and more triathlons next yearnice overview of the different watches ive got a garmin fenix s sapphire which i really love if i were to buy a new one today i would probably just upgrade to the newer fenix  modelcurrently using an older forerunner and would love an upgrade thank you again for very informative video i personally picked up fr  and would love for my husband to have fr  instead of my handed over vivoactive  music so he can experience the navigation and amazing battery lifeforerunner  has been amazing for my needsthe forerunner  would be perfect for my half marathon training which starts in january thank you for the video still not sure about the forerunner  or the  something you did not mention was how much longer will the older forerunner models be supported with updates i would go for the  with the big bright screen where i do not run with my glassesgreat breakdown thanks folks i still have my aa battery fr and computeronthewrist  ive had the fr  and venu my current is the fenix s pro and ilove it id like the amoled screen but im a health care worker  i hike and watersportim afraid id scratch it up and the sapphire garmins are not in my budget yet so the epix pro sapphire is my next watch maybe preloved or next year on saleim running my first ultramarathon next year so id pick the fenix pro  for the battery life and the mapsgreat video ive been looking for garmin range to be explained if i were to choose one i would love the instinct crossover i could put it through its paces being the it says its military gradethe fitness smartwatches from garmin like the vivoactive series are absolutely fine for runners that just want the basics whilst running  pace elapsed time laps heart rate etc  i have used a vivoactive  for years and it is fine though i guess i have never really pushed the battery life as i am really only running up to half marathon distancei am an indonesian doctor  years old  started running regularly about a year ago i am having garmin venu sq st generation as a gift i am having hard time to pace my race i am thinking about upgrading to forerunner  i hope to win the watch from the running channel thanks for the videomy favourite garmin watch is the apple ultra absolutely love it though id love to try a garmin my go to would be the forerunner i do a lot of biking trekking mountaineering wakeboarding snowboarding so i definitely need something like the epix gen  to stay durable through everythinggood vid i do like the bright screens struggle sometimes with my xt not being able to read it while running  could do with a bigger font sizegreat video  i use a garmin  and it is time to think about replacing it as the battery is not what it used to beive never been into tech for running but since i got my  i cant run without it im still clueless about all the fancy options but would love to upgrade to the currently wearing the venus which i got before i started running and still works great but i am think about an upgrade for one of the foterunner watches for the additional features i would choose the fenix s i love the look and the functionality of itive been eyeing the fenix  pro for a while now yr old i work in construction and currently use an apple watchseries  my wife and do spartan races and try to fit in a half marathon when we can currently just training to fit into my tux for my wedding my apple watch just doesnt last the day for me early morning runs and a long work day tends to just drain my battery so i constantly need to turn off my watch screen so it can last me all day definitely loving the forerunner  i think it would help me stay on track and will actually use the watchim on my second iteration of the vivoactive with a s and love them they do what i need them to do and dont look out of place for everyday wear so i would opt for the s i really love the  i have polar now but definatly thinking about upgrading and switching to garmingreat explanation of the range andy  would be my choice it has all the features but not as heavy or bulky as the epix or fenix linesfenix  pro is an amazing watch with great battery backup also solar charging features i love to have this one as im looking forward to having one in future that will be my first smartwatch tooi am trying to figure out what possibly could be the better option to me as i have never owned a garmin always been apple user but this helped alot and now i have  options to dig deep and read about  venu  or forerunner thanks alot i have the garmin forerunner  music and keep thinking about needing to upgrade i definitely like the idea of the venu range or a newer model forerunnerlots to think over now forerunner  will be great addition to my running because my fenix  didnt gave me whole week suggestionsthat was very informative  im thinking the forerunner  is the one for meive been using the venu  for almost  years but would love to have the  i think it would give me the confidence to try running in new places with the awesome navigation featuresi could make good use of the forerunner   the screen looks so good and the mapping features look greatepix pro gen  with amoled currently have fenix  but that screen is just so nice thanks for this summary ive been using an apple watch for years and im ready to upgrade to the forerunner i got the forerunner  as soon as i started running this year i have my eyes on the forerunner  nowim currently using a vivoactive i purchased in  i think the forerunner  would be amazing as im really looking to push myself beyond the k in the new yearafter having had surgery due to an acl tear im moving away from soccer and looking to pick up triathlon when im fully recovered the garmin forerunner  would be an amazing watch the help me along my triathlon journeyid go for the  would be a nice upgrade great video thanksnewbie to smartwatch and this blows my mindforrunner  would be my pick although i would love any of the watches i just got into running and dont have one yet so im sure any of them would help with my running and tracking i would be grateful with winning any of them at first i thought i wanted the best the  or one of the outdoor watch but i dont think i need that level yet and the  might be the best value for my actual use considering ill have a phone on me with a map great videobeen running on and off for a few years and planning on going for my first half marathon next year i currently have a vivomove hr cause i like having the analogue watch as well but wanting inbuilt gps capability for longer runs so purely for this would love an instinct crossover though cant justify the cost right nowwanna get back to running and looking for a watch that will help me achieve my goals i think the forerunner  will be the best one for mejust started running been looking into getting a garmin and would really like the phoenix seven pro saving up for one at the moment so to win one would be amazingam in my forties and only running for  years but done loads of half marathons would love a forerunner  to take me to the next level for marathons and ultra trailsawesome video breaking down the difference between each series i have been using samsung watch  classic and have times it ran out of battery mid run which is super annoying epic pro seems like a good choice for me for a definite upgrade cheersthank you for the videoi wonder what laptop not apple could be good to edit the k videocurrently ive got a forerunner  and would love to upgrade to a  mainly because i love the running stats and would like more and a  day suggested workouthello  thanks for the effort  i dont have a garmin yet however its what i want and you are the first of many that have broken down the types of garmins in a way that makes sense to a newbie like me  nothing against other channels they are all great but this review laid out the ecosystem in a way with price points that helps me make sense of it all because its confusing if  the give away is still available i think im open for either a venu  or forerunner  or instinct seriesi think the instinct x is an impressive watch loads of features and a pretty nice look toogreat video so many watches think the forunner  l looks best replacement for my forunner i really want a garmin watch  especially the solar   really keen on the running assist feature but just tracking my overall health is what i want mostid love to get my hands on the forerunner  solar the incredible battery life plus all the advanced features would make it perfect for road and trail running and would help with training for my next marathoncurrently have the xt would love the useful insight im hoping the forerunner  drops in price on black friday a free one would be best grest video currently using a forerunner  but i would really like to upgrade to fenix  pro regular size cheerswould be the fenix  for me  great for golf as well as runningepic pro  is the one i would go for a great watch and helps with varied routes so you do not get bored if you are like me and a little directional challenged it would stop you ending up on a motorway with a just your running gear yes this did happen the health snapshots and brighter screen are a great advantage with a reasonable battery lifeid love to have the forerunner s that amoled display have been running for a little while love the old mips screens but been looking to upgrade to the forerunner  of the amoledvery detailed video thanks for sharing id really like the fenix  pro in the x size i like the solar charging and that its a very big watch most of the other watches are too small for me even though i dont have a big wrist  inches i just like large watches and they dont make them big enough what a great review thanksi have been using fenix since year  so far besides the bluetooth pairing issue with iphone the rest are still working well the durability  endurance level are really good if possible would like to have wither forerunner or fenix series where it surely will helps  motivate me further on achieving my running  cycling goalsi like the enduro  details features and data also wanting the super rugged aspect of the instinct every time i am looking at the selection of watches i feel like theres not the one watch that would do it all for me i guess the fenix really is what i would end up getting once i can spare the extra cash cant wait to pair it with my hrm pro plusat least this video is covering some stuff i havent seen beforethank for this my forerunner  has just about come to the end of its life so im shopping for a replacement but its not easy to choose wife has the vivoactive  but im used to the features of the forerunner itll probably be the  as im not sure i can justify the jump to the i like to have the epic pro sapphire the  properly good enough for me but i did like it to be more metal raised bezel to be more protective in the environment and also the led flashlight for safety and useful when neededgreat videoid love the forerunner s i have the forerunner  already which i really like but the chance to upgrade to help my training for my first marathon in october would be fabwould love the venu would be my best christmas gift in many years since childhood  runs  a week for me using my fenix xhope to start running more and will upgrade to a epix garmin  for me thx i have a  which is still working but man that  looks nicestarted running a  minute warm at the gym last year i say running couldnt even last that long this year at  i ran my first k then completed  parkruns since and even even managed k training runs all the while using my garmin fr to look at the numbers and see the slight improvements looking at trading up to the fr to get even more useful data as i push on to the goals of a k next year probably now and my rd and th hyrox events in january and march im definitely not a runner runner but more hybrid than anything but still the forerunner range is more than enough for my needsa fenix  pro x would be slight upgrade on my slightly broken xt  very informative video as always andy thanksi am into long distance cycling ever since covid started i am planning to take part in a few ultra distance races next year and would like to own an epix pro gen  also i have a big hand so would prefer the mm version my forunner  covers all my bases atm just placed the  on my wishlist having to stop and pull out my phone to navigate on new routes can be annoying love the display qualitythanks for this video as im tempted by the forerunner  but i think its just too big would have to go forerunner i got my epix gen  watch and i love it if i should choose between all the models i think epix pro  mm would be the perfect choice for mewould definitely go for the forerunner  started running this year also triathlon training lookig forwar to getting one in order to get more data out of my trainingim currently using fenix  and im thinking about upgrading it to  those hills and endurance indicators looks interesting as ive just started preparations to next season and im about to go through a lot of hill and trial running sessionsi have the fenix s  absolutely adore it my husband has an awful smart watch wont name the brand but id love to gift him a new garmin especially with xmas coming up either the forerunner or the fenix series would be perfect were both runners loved the vid i am in the market and have watched hundreds of videos it seems but yours is quality and to the point i wish i could afford the higher end garmins but sadly there is no correlation between semavid runner and income p  that being said i would love to win any of the high end watches or the  thanksi am currently training for my first iron man triathlon and having a good watch would help massivelyfinnaly someone made a video explaining the basics of every model didnt know newer models had flashlights anyways the epix  looks greati am very interested in the forerunner  watch because i think it will be the most suitable for my running in a few months i will run a marathon for the first time you can wish me good luck and i hope i will be able to use the watch have the venu but definitely been eyeing some of the new features of the venu  also been debating on the runners and outdoor ones for some of the features such as maps and training daily suggestionsive been looking for a replacement for my apple watch because the battery life is just terrible i ran my first marathon earlier this month and my apple watch was difficult to use once your hands got sweaty im leaning more towards the forerunner series and this video truly helped narrowing my choices downvery interested in the garmin watches have enjoyed running for a while but just started getting into tracking my progress doing some indoor runs with zwift i think the forerunner seems like a good choicewhat a good video as a samsung watch  user battery life is killing the mooi sometimes i have to charge every day and loose the data my first marathon in september i barely had my strava run h min  secondsforerunner  would be helping a lot to improve for my next marathon in march or the epix i love the amoled screen when i search them online keep up the good workgreetings from belgiumi started with a forerunner  which my daughterinlaw has now inherited  i now love my forerunner  but if i were to go for an upgrade it would be the forerunner i use the  solar swapped it for my old fenix back end of last year  i dont care about the fancy screens  i want the most metrics  in the lightest package with the most battery life  no complaints at allthe one thing i miss with my  is the full mapping for when im leading runs for my club the turn by turn stuff is excellent but mapping would be even better if i had unlimited budget id go for the fenix  for surethe   i really like the petals on the lilly too  but for all the important stuff  would be my pick great explanation and the features all look really lovely training for marathon with my forerunner  so an upgrade to the  would help a lot but i cant give that too much attention since im the one running not the watch garmin   for me  after a season running i think it he would help take running to  the next level  also i quite fancy varying off the road and colour mapping would definitely help me do thatcurrently using forerunner  but tempted by venu s for everyday use when not runningi currently have a fenix  hr which i got when iy was first released and have worn every day for nearly  years the battery doesnt last that long anymore but it used to be amazing for multiday hiking trips and the altimeter registers all my runs as having more than  feet of elevation gain buts its still kicking the sapphire glass is completely scratch free stillwould live to get a fenix  pro solar sapphire so that i can get a big battery sturdy watch to last me another  yearsi had the chance to try on and test it for a few minutes the forerunner  more functions i need i love it maybe one dayas a begginer runner i think the forerunner  would be perfect as it also has music playback capabilitylooking at the garmin fr  please  just a runner so the fr meets all my needs i have an older version that is losing its battery now so high time for an upgrade and keen to check out the new screenthe forerunner  looks like an amazing watch for all kinds of runs  im really into data so it would be a perfect match for melove the functionality on my fenix   but there are times when its tricky to see the screen ageing process sucks id be keen to try a  to see how good the amoled is ive heard such good things about itim really interested in the forerunner  as i love the map feature and the outlook of a week of suggested workoutsi am looking for a watch that i can take with me for mountain biking i wanted one with maps like fenix or epic this was a very useful videoill have the forerunner  please the round route feature is something id love i hate doing out and backs and running somewhere ive already beenive been eyeing the  and fenix  for quite a while now if i had to chose it would probably be the fenix the forerunner  seems like the perfect fitness watch for my needs with its advanced running features and smart notificationsgreat review of all the watches  i use an apple watch but would like to switch over to garmin  i keep looking at the forerunner  fenix and epix versions and think id want the as a fairly new runner id love a forerunner watch especially the  because i just really find the features fit my needs and interests best  the navigation the data are all things that would make my life easierhi im  bookworm student and started running a year ago to challenged myself what im capable of my stamina improve a lot from pace  and now im at pace  last week i joined marathon km and im secure a place really look up for latest garmin forerunner  but have no budget because im still studentdefinitely interested in that epix pro great video after multiple injuries and long rehabilitation i have to approach training in a different and better way i am looking for a sports watch where you can record  data of mainly  my running training but also cycling swimming and fitness to combine for a better training schedule a sleep function that records your sleep is also useful as i am a bad sleeper im interesting in    the fnix   sapphire solar for there scratchfree  display and the longer batery life im also looking at  the garmin   i think this is the best watch for my budget  with the focus more on running  im curious how accurate they are and how they perform compared to the apple watch ultra  i hope to be able to start the year sportingly thanks for your advice keep on runningi would love the forerunner  preparing for my first marathon age for me the forerunner  will be perfect sometimes i run on a new route and i have to check my phone to almost every corner where to turn in d  so the navigation is very important for mei bought a forerunner  a few years ago and its been great  if i was going to get a replacement id go with an epic pro xfor that sweet amoled and touchscreeni currently have a  which is very good  the amoled displays look really goodepix pro gen  not only for my running but also with my other outdoor activitiesi am a mexican college track athlete and i have never had a garim i have been watching them for years and i think they are the best smartwatches on the market any watch would be great but my favorites are the  and the epix proive had two garmin vivoactive watches and loved them but now im running more i am thinking the extra features of some of the fenix watches would be usefuli think id go for the s i have small wrists and some of the other watches just look too clumsy im also interested in the suggested workouts to see how they can improve my running and overall fitness thank u for explaining everything about all types i has active s and died in salt water i am running and i dont have the watch to measure my timings and distance i am pretty sure that runner  will be great for me thank u so muchi wish i could get the forerunner  it looks incredible training for my first marathon next year hopefully a trail one also hoping to enter the scarfel pike marathon moved from the fr to fenixx for the mapping but as a data geek would love to try the xpro or epix for some of the new software featuresgreat videogreat explanation on the wide range of watch if i could choose a watch i would go for the   for navigation suggested workout with goa all the metric removing the guessing out of trainingl the nice screen  epic gen  pro is really interessting but not sure about the weigthonly started running in late may this year i purchased a forerunner  music which is a great bit of kit but the newer models do have a few more features that would definitely help with my training in preparation for next years london marathon i would have to go for the forerunner  why wouldnt youi have been using the fitbit ionic for the last few years but that finally gave up  i have been researching various smart watches fitness watches and have decided on garmin  probably looking at the forerunner  but if lucky enough to win i would opt for the forerunner thank you for the helpful video is the  the only watch with the round trip feature is it also the only watch that offers turn by turn navigation on the watch during a run or do others offer thati have the forerunner s currently and would definitely recommend it for any runners would love to win a fenix  pro s to upgrade to include running power metrics and better multi sport capacityi got a forerunner  this year and am really loving it can get quite obsessed about stats for an upgrade i wouldnt mind getting a forerunner   which watches in particular have the ultratrac mode considering a fr but still not sure if i should bump up the budget a bit for more batterylove how many of the garmin watches have a s version ive got the  currently but excited to upgrade to the s whenever i get a good enough excuse pdefinitely need an upgrade on my forerunner  hopefully santa  brings me  great vidoh wow all of those look great i would love the forerunner  or honestly a fenix its definitely time for me to upgrade from my apple watchtraining for my first triathlon so a new watch would be perfectwould love the  but its definitely on the more expensive side currently have a  but want an upgrade as im looking at some longer distance races in the next year and want the extra battery lifegreat to see all the different watches i run with a fenix  which does me the  is the gold standard but will it make you run fasteri currently have the garmin forerunner  solar  a brighter screen would be nice so will probably opt for the epix  next timeive had the forerunner  for a couple of years it does a lot of what i need  want it to do definitely looking out for deals on the long time garmin fan  i started with a vivoactive  then a venu and now a venu    id love to have an epix mm now that i am moving from half marathons to k first one in august to my first marathon next fall   the more sophisticated training features would be amazing as would longer battery life for longer runs   the amoled screens are a must for outdoor activities   i have a fitbit i wear as part of a us medical study and i absolutely cannot see anything in the screen in bright daylight  its just pointless until you get indoors againi have the fenix s and would love the epix gen for its amoled screen everything is clearer and brighter with ithard to choose but the fenix  pro is really beautiful and is full optionsi have been runnimg on and off for about years and i just finished my first half marathon last month i got a second hand vivoactive  and compared with my old forerunner  it is a serious upgrade but i am thinking about a more running centric watch like the forerunner currently have the fenix s which has been great getting into running though im still at the stage this sucks and why does it hurt so much bizarrely im still out  to  mornings a week as im training for rtts  and runsandringham  hour the only thing that worries me about my current garmin is the battery running out during the events which is why id probably choose the enduro  great video garmins lineup is so confusing ive got purchase paralysisi never would want a flashlight in a running watch until now fenix s pro sapphire solari would go for the epix pro have a fr and have no complaintsi love my  but would like a upgrade has really helped my improve my running only thing it is mussing for me is hitthe forerunner  is perfect for my goal of getting a sub marathon for cheers for the video andy i was looking at getting the fenix  pro as a christmas present to myself but after your video i dont know what ill get anyway if youre giving a fenix  pro away id be a delightful recipient im definitely interested in the epix pro gen mm it would be the perfect watch for all of my running strength and hiking activitiesi really really want the forerunner   of the epix but lighter cheaper and bigger screen thanks for the videocurrently enjoying the fenix  but battle to read the display without my specs   amoled screen on the large forerunner  sounds like a winnervery useful video my vivoactive  has just died after  years or so  i think ill go for a forerunner  nextid love to upgrade from my  to the  pro sapphire for my next multiday ultra better maps better battery life and the stamina metric would be super handyepix progarmin watches deliver quality i am still using my xt after  years still great battery life and continues to get updates from garmin the downside i dont have an excuse to buy a new one as it keeps on going strongbeen chasing a sub  minute k for a while now and i feel like im almost there  i would probably go for the forerunner  as they both have all the features i would find interestinguseful without going overboardi have started training for my first marathon which should be a familiar feeling andy though i have nowhere near your sports history but after four years of enthusiastic cycling including a tour de france grand fondo and the coast to coast in a day i felt i wanted a running challenge again so a marathon it is i also know that my apple watch is not going to cut it at a marathon so i have decided to probably move to the fenix  pro  instead of the apple watch ultra garmin has so many more interesting features for training that it seems to be a much better partner plus i will get to discover all of those great new functions rick shares on the podcast so those are my thoughts at the moment and if i would win it through the channel id be willing to do a video with it on my first marathon for you i like fenix   out of all watches the titanium metal and graphite band looks sleek after i just ran my first half marathon i am really looking into upgrading my old fitbit to something a bit more and i really want to give garmin another go now that theyve introduced more size options ive got a very small wristthis video could not have come at a more perfect time been using an apple watch for all my runs but i will be running the  nyc marathon and was hoping to purchase a new running watch to aid in my trainingin addition is the epix pro nd gen worth its price compared to the forerunner  i only currently run and workout i have been using the vivoactive  for a couple of years now time for some well needed upgrade vivoactive  looks great but all thes features on the forerunner  are tempting that  does look nice with the new screen just abit too pricy at the moment thanks for the reviewi would go for the  epic screen with all the features id ever needim currently looking out for a forerunner  music  this is especially because its the first one in the forerunner series with music integration which is very important for me on my runshello thanks for reviewing all those watches i have been doing sports all my life but have never get a hand on any smart watches may i ask what garmin smart watch is suitable for mountaineering and at the same time able to upload stats on strava would appreciate if any could recommend me one thanksall of the forerunners or the fenixes would be great but really  it is the epix  saphire that is my choice  what an incredible watch fingers crossednice video i already own a fr  but im ver interested in the fenix  pro as i like the mip display and its more premium design than the  has is the allrounder for meive always had fenix watches starting with the fenix  would love to have an epix pro mainly for the amoled screenlooking to upgrade from my applewatch want something mallet geared towards running but would also like for hiit  golf use any ideasjust got my  two weeks ago and i couldnt be happier do i need all of the features no but the screen is so damn prettyim currently using a garmin vivosport band and i like how superior its gps capability is over my android phonewhat id look for in a smartwatch is the gpsaccuracy a bright and sharp display and the ability to play music during my runs over bluetooth also maybe having esim option so i could leave my phone home  i like having it with me for any emergency calls if neededi guess for most of these features an epix pro or a forerunner  would be the best choice id be happy to win either of them hey there great overview of the garmin product linei would be really happy to win the fenix s fingers crossed i have previously had a  i think and if i would go for a new watch i would probably go for the forerunner  a bit bigger a bit easier to use on the run more advanced and refined features are the main components for me making that assumptioni currently have a vivoactive   had it for almos  years now i think im a techgeek but also a student and training for a km trail run i am very privileged to have the watch i have now but i feel that maybe there is something better for me i am also partime in the norwegian home guard and think that i have more use for a more robust watch my training week consists of everything from intervals to  km long runs hiit strength swimming and road cycling  skiing and slalom these days i live in norway after all the goal is to do ultra and maybe try triathlon i think the forerunner  fenix  pro epix pro gen  or the enduro  would be a great match for me excuse my bad english its much easier to talk than writeto be honest i would love to win a fenix s right now its my dream watch as a student money often is tight so you work with what you have for me at the moment is my phone this year i ran my first two half marathons which got me hook to running thanks for the overviewthe fenix  pro seems amazing packing that much technology into a watchim an experienced runner that ran in college and took a break from running after college i have recently started training for a marathon and am looking for a watch that could help me train for it i think the firerunner  would be the watch i would choose if i won based on the features and what im looking fornot mentioned as it isnt a running feature but a big selling point on upgrading from the vivoactive  to the  was the golf feature and all the preloaded golf course i love all the extra running features on this watch but also getting the golf options was awesomelikely should have gotten the fenix  pro x for the larger screen as i need reading glasses but i can make out enough of the data on the  to justify not spending the extra moneyi did have an apple watch between the vivo and  but the battery life was horribleandy what a great video nailed it with so much data talk and still hooked on to the end  i would love to win a garmin watch the new generation of fenix  pro is also with amoled screen that one could be nice or the forerunner  like you self  im only running and walking so maybe thats the one  or the epic are bada  so hard to choose just getting into the world of ultras at the young age of would love the garmin enduro the  seems the most well balanced would be great to have the mapping and routing capability especially in a new city to be able to get back to a start point and select distance without have to manually plan the route that feature edges it above the  which are otherwise great watches would have been good to hear if the spo metric is available in all the watchesi have been running since august to lose weight and to gain fitness i have achieved my weight goal in september to my surprise and i fell in love with running since and i have started training for a half marathon but i dont have a smart watch so i run with my  i would love the  forerunner i feel it will help me with my plans for next year since i dont have access to training facilities or coaches the suggestions feature will help me a lot thanks for a great content as always and congrats for the winner if i dont winout of all of these three forerunner  looks like the one for me ive got the forerunner  and would love something with more metrics to assist my runningforerunner s ive currently got the forerunner  music my dream upgrade would be the forerunner  i like that with garmin everyone can find best fitting piece i am happy with my fenix s pro but would be interested in new features on fenix  pro  or forerunner fenix  pro looks so nice i use a fr at the moment but would like to upgrade to a fr as i am really happy with the forerunner serieshi guys recently discovered your channel and podcasts im a newish runner looking to get a fr but dont normally wear watches so dont want anything too expensive in case i hate it can you compare the new fr vs  and  thanksmarki am a big fan of hiking running offroad gravel bike i think garmin enduro  would be perfect for a person like methe forerunner  looks to have amazing mapping featuresive been running for about  years now but a bit inconsistently various injuries taking time off etc in fact im injured right now but its not actually from running  i played too hard with my dog and twisted my ankle  anyway for me i think the forerunner  would be ideal as im not super experienced with running nor do i need every fancy feature or many metrics but i definitely like the idea of reliable navigation and the suggested workoutsi would really like the forerunner  the mip screen and flat glass profile for a screen protector would be really nice my  year old vivosmart hr is ready to be replaced and i am looking forward to my first half marathon the upcomming springi would go for the epix pro of the fenix as someone who works in the outdoors and regularly finds themselves in harsh mountainous environments or paddling on a range of rivers id love something that would survive a busy day at work as well as something that could record lots of stats of my runs and walks i still love my forerunner s but it is looking a bit battered after several years of constant daily use i would choose the epix pro gen   mainly for the combo of battery life screen maps and flashlight good for running and hikingi currently use a  but would love to upgrade to the been eyeing the forerunner  for a while but i find i hard to justify the expense since my polar m  years old still worksive only ever run k and k and this year im taking on my biggest objective yet which is a k trail race  and i feel like the garmin  would be the perfect accessory to support me  definitely the   as someone who has just started running after a bet with a friend to run a marathon in  months time  a watch that could help with training would be awesomegreat love them all specially the solar ones i am still on apple watch this would be a good change and option for the futurecurrently have the instinct solar but really want the i would love the   im still on my forerunner  since ive started running four years ago its maybe time for an updatei would go for garmin forerunner  because it has all the features i use currently i run with coros pace fenix nice run through of all the watches winning a  would be sweetive got back into running again in the last few months and im currently using an apple watch but the battery is starting to run pretty low on long runs and im starting to doubt it will make it through a marathon ive been looking at the epix as i quite want to try getting into trail running tooyoung runner here i currently have the forerunner  and am heading into a promising track season any upgrade whether it be a    or  would be much appreciated generally looking for all around improvements with better insight into training plans sleep heart rate data and vo max specifications to improve my trainingive been following the running channel for quite a while i wish i could get epix gen  that would really help my goal of running a marathon i live in the united states not sure if youre going to ship the watch from the uk thanks love your videosi have a fenix  pro as i am getting old i find it difficult to see some information while running so i think i need to change it for the fenix  xive only been running about  years but in my experience the forerunner series as been reliable for me as a college runner i dont really need all the features of the newer forerunner series but a new watch would be nice i currently use a  but i havent found it to be that accurate distancewise when doing workouts on a track any longer than  miles continuous in one effort or rep and it starts clocking me as hitting the  mark anywhere from  meters to  meters early also happens on occasion when doing m repeats not the biggest pain but its a tad inconvenient to have to manually lap it slightly after i cross the line when it autolaps early heard that the  has more accurate gps so wouldnt mind getting something newer than the  to have something even more accurate i also tend to avoid trail runs because the gps dips out at random so im not getting the most accurate distance or pacethe cream gold fenix s pro is so darn pretty i would love to take it along my adventures so many options been thinking about getting the  but now the  also looks great however the  would be a dream epix pro id go for the forerunner  has everything i need as a multisport athletegarmin forerunner  looks very appealing for me great video got a fenix  at mo would love to upgrade to fenixwould opt for a  or epix pro with age a more readable screen is important  round trip routes sounds usefulim all in on the fenix x pro sapphire i like running but i love ocr and there is nothing tougher than the fenixnice video i expected to see the descend or similar also mentioned in the video so in other words yes im going into a direction of needing the sort of diving computer as an amateur breath diver but diving happens more rarely for me than eg hiking and for that reason i need at least a water resistant watch and indestructible in terms of hiking or climbing and for that reason id pick  fenix  pro  sapphire or epix pro   sapphire due to the battery life and a nice scree and it seems like its really indestructible and perhaps id be tartgeting the x size i have the venu  plus very nice and i run and practice mtb on weekends nevertheless ive seen some videos that shows all the metrics for the forerunner i really want one of these and as i dont like mip display id really love to have the im really interested in the garmin forerunner  i think the data from running is the part i am looking for the mostim doing an ultra next year in the welsh mountains so for me id love the mad watch for me the venu seems amazing having a watch that looks sleek for work in an office while  stil being amazing for training and actually having such a good battery life compared to other lifestyle watches im looking at you pixel watchi currently use a garmin  which i think is great but do find the screen a bit dull and hard to read sometimes therefore i would love the  with amoled screenlove my s only regret is not getting the larger size i wish that it had drag and drop mp and wireless charging capabilities thoughepix pro gen  sapphire  mm looks so niceits that  for me im thinking about doing an ultra at some point  but im terrible at navigation  so thinking i need the forerunner  or the enduro in the coming year i am training up for daunting km race i have never really had a running watch but i think having am in the market a fenix  solar would probably be perfect as it would provide long battery life and all the training metrics i would needalthough id love to have the forerunner  or  id say the  probably has the best value for money for the type of activities id usually do which is mostly just running my longest run is k at the moment and my neighbourhood is pretty hard to get lost in so the simpler map feature is plentycurious about forerunner  and epix seriesforerunner  would be perfect to replace my aging garmin watch as i train for my second ultra the pennine barrier  miles on may thin forerunner  i would love a forerunner   the combination of an amoled screen with premium features looks very impressive to meepix pro gen i like the built in flashlight and the amoled screenthe garmin  would make a lovely addition to my wrist on occasions i do still rock up to parkrun with my forerunner  and i do get a number of strange looks  being a bit of a data geek though i do like my newer garmin devices especially those with amoled which i can read more easily than mip for that reason my next watch will be the epix pronice compessive video would love to replaced my scratched fenix  pro for epix l to take on my runs swims rides or any other adventure tacoi also am coming from an apple watch i think the forerunner  would be the easiest garmin watch to transition into i love the designcurrently have the fr  love it but wouldnt mind the better battery life of the fenix series watchwould love a forerunner  currently running with an apple watch  and definitely noticing how much data im missingi would go for the instinct x solar for helping running at night with the lamp its pretty convenient im debating between the instinct x and the forerunner i have enjoyed using the forerunner  but i would really like a bigger screen i like the forerunner range and the  would be my choice and it would give me that extra incentive to go for that runive got a forerunner s which is good but often slow to lock on to gps  a modest upgrade to the forerunner  perhapsi love me garmin  but i really like the look of the new oled displays i have an old apple watch  but it really isnt enough now that ive started training for a half marathon the epix pro size m would help me incredibly especially with all the trails nearby meid choose the instinct line all day every day the instinct x is my perfect utilitarian watch for my use caseas an occasional scuba diver im looking at the descent mk pricey but has everything the epix has  a dive computeri would love to have the forerunner  or the epix pro i love garmins watches and would love to upgrade i would love one of the forerunner watches i currently dont have a smartwatch to track my runscurrently running with the  but would love the opportunity to upgrade to the  particularly love those amoled displays plus id get to give my brother my  who has just started running and achieved his first sub min ki have not yet owned a watch for running but i like the forerunner love long outdoor activities  instinctx solar would be perfect to rise adventures to the next level as a newbie i started with an apple watch then switched to a humble forerunner but i feel like i now need more detailed metrics and maps would dream of getting an epix pro i would go for the  has most the bells and whistles but for less than the epix linehey friends at the running channel great video sometimes with so many models it can be confusing i would love to have the high tech stats that the forerunner  s provides but cant afford it hopefully i can be the lucky winner enjoyed the video although i note that you didnt quote the battery life of the  if i were to win one of these the fr  would be my preferenceid love if the instinct  x had onboard music it would then be my perfect watch audio prompts to keep you on target music to keep you motivated and garmin pay for the coffees and cake after your parkrun for maps navigation which one is better between forerunner  and epix gen pro  that amoled screen i would love the mapping of the  but would i be able to justify it maybe it would inspire me to sign up for some trail eventsusing the fr used it for a couple of ultramarathons but after a few years the battery is struggling either i need an enduro  or shave a few hours off my timei am torn between fenix  pro epix and enduro main goal is to track sport activity mtb sup and windfoil mainly maybe some hiking and swimmingall in all i would opt for the enduro  as a watch to win if i could get the fr solar then it would be a dream since my mum is going to get her knee surgery soon so i cant afford to spend on watch now and my current fr had suffer infinite boot loop ive just started running again  months ago with my fr owned for  years  month because ive been having trouble sleeping now my sleep had improved a lot and at the same time shed around kg so far it feels great to be back on my local running track but i really did not expect it to quit on me so soonmy choice would definitely be watch from fenix series or enduro im a very outdoorsy person and despite my age  yo i still enjoy outdoor activities also advance health features are important for me as well especially at my age large screen makes a difference too my eyes are not what they used to be  i live in poland and needless to say i cant afford any of those watches as a happy coros user i am occasionally tempted to try another garmin to see if they are any better than the awful fenix i would be keen to try an enduro  as it is the one that competes on battery life so for the perspective of a giveaway thats definitely the one i would want ive been running with an apple watch for the last  years and after really getting into running properly this year id love to train with a garmin forerunner s as i think it would really help me with my half marathon training for my half marathon in february i picked up the instinct  a few months ago but didnt realise how great the garmin ecosystem is had i known i would have invested a bit more and got the fancier fenix xi want the epix pro gen  sapphireit seems like the overall best one and could be great for helping me plan since i just started running and get exhausted in a few minutesive been running with my forerunner  i guess it has everything i need the only feature i would like is music so id like to up grade to the fr musicstarted running  years ago come on quite a bit since but my trusty garmin  i bought back then is starting to die a death battery life is fading and now starting to show low battery when i have  left  could definitely do with an upgrade to the currently have the  but would love to upgrade to i would go with the instinct  crossover solar would be ideal i like the look and the long ladting battery id love to have a fenix s pro  sapphire solar out of interest what is your wrist circumference as a reference point thankspace pro which can adjust to true track inclination and pacing strategy and how to tackle the hill preference skewing is a unique selling point which i hill and trail lover truly miss on my polar watches polar offer only a crude distance and race goal time input then guide you on one pace only no matter what hill lies in front of you not even a positivenegative splitting option im curious about the coros watches heard only good things about them but ive neglected them somehowmy fitness status is little bit weak so im trying to improve that but i cant track my progress so i always think about garmin  or  watch if have a chance to have it that is gonna be the best thing i have ever happened in this christmasnice videoive been eyeing  as my brain just works off numbers  first marathon next year so id put it to a good test garmin forerunnernewbe hear ready to ditch my apple watch for sure not yet sure which one is for me but leaning to the venu  bit sure if the forerunner  also shows messages and pictures in the messenger also how it performs in the gym and does it also has the new gen heart rate sensor great video thank youhi everyone would all the notifications of the  or  work on an iphone thanksbecause i am training for a marathon at the moment the forerunner  would improve my training routine by fare thanks for the nice content all the time and the giveawaythe forerunner  has to be the best watch for a runner i think thats the next watch im going to buyim the owner of a mm garmin epix gen  a gift for my birthday which was yesterday im only watching these videos because i want to find out how this thing works im a  mile per week runner longest run  miles a fenix pro mm would be my choicehuge fan of long battery life so garmin enduro  is my go toid love to try out the forerunner  at rotterdam marathon next year using an apple watch for my running as of right now ive been wanting to switch to the forerunner  since it came out but mentally having a hard time dishing out that  for a new watch a garmin would improve my running immensely for philly marathon  i would love to try a fenix or something with all of the fitness profiles plus solari started running again after yrs due to two tough pregnancies i started up gradually and ive been running for weeks now and reached my k goal of under min now im amped to keep going i used to do a k under min  i lost all interest in running and now i have refound it i live on a small island so travel is our escape and different terrain and locations is the challenge im a  yo mom of two beautiful girls and i need to keep up with them  i would love to try a fitness watch especially with maps and a light when its dark is when i get to go out so i would love a spoil like the fnix  pro mm sive always looked at the fnyx  as a potential upgrade aiming to do more trail running but the enduro  is absolutely bonkers  im afraid that kind of metric would give me the urges to do an ultra marathon which im definetly not ready fori started running this february and im still not sure my running style is my longest run was km which i  run in  hours and  minutes last month i planned to cover km before i reached  well i an  years old this year im happy to try the forerunner  due to is coaching systemi like the smaller size option of the s because i have a small wrist but i am starting to do more trail runs so i think the  is going to be the better option for mejust wish it came in a smaller sizei think i would like the forerunner  it has all the features i would ever wantive been training with a forerunner  music but id love to upgrade to the i would like to have the instinct x it seems quite hard enough for my multi activities thanksid love a new garmin watch so heres me crossing my fingersjust ordered a garmin gps smart watch that was not on your list  the descent mki mm its basically an epix with a dive computer the instinct  is pretty radi wanted a  or  but the size is preposterous on my wrist so i went with the s so far ive loved it but i do wish they offered a swould love the new fenix got venu  and looking at using it to the max and then maybe switching to  or epixis it worth if i just run and hike winning here would mean i could try the epix ones want to buy my wife garmin watch as a holiday present  still cant figure it outshe uses fenix s at the moment  and i am leaning towards epix gen   sapphire edition   mm in white colouror would be same pro version better  what is the differenceany suggestions are appreciatedive been running here and there for a few years and would really like to take my running to the next level would love to win the forerunner s the forerunner  would be perfect for me forerunner  would be amazing just because navigation  for round trip routei bought the coros pace  but the heart rate sensor was broken i tested it a few days and wasnt so happy with some features thats why i want to upgrade i cant decide between forerunner  and the fenix  pro solar the latter is on sale for  i want to track running but also other sportsim quite an experienced runner and ive enjoyed the forerunner  but looking at the  that could be a great upgrade from the giveaway of course considering switching from my apple watch interested in the epix pro gen   sapphire edition   mmdont currently use a watch of any kind i do a lot of walking and hiking so the instinct s seems best but i am constantly trying to get back into running so i think for me the forerunner  is best for price and function for a lowlevel runnerid love to get an upgrade on my forerunner  preferably the  or i need a rugged workhorse with all the most important features so ill stick with my instinct solar thank you garmin just finished couch to k not too long ago and aiming for the k in london in feb partner has also got into running trying to convince her to get a garmin maybe a s or s instead of her fitbit which doesnt have gps one day maybe shell get an epix gen out of our price range for nowi currently have a forerunner  but its not holding its charge so well these days i would love an upgrade to a fenix  proim new to running and have no smart watch or fitness watch id love the forerunner  as an intro to the range and help with my k trainingstarted running  years ago as a way to lose some weight next year ill try my first k ultra marathonbeskydska  so enduro  for that would be probably perfect but i think my trusty fenix  pro will handle it near identicali would go for fnix pro because of its sleek design  fits all whether wearing a suit or pijamas  and of course the battery life that what mattersgarmin is one of those companies you just have to respect they know theyre the best at what they do i love how expensive their devices are and how little they seem to care about packaging lol their products speak for themselvesi would choose the garmin enduro  the extra battery for long trips would be very usefuljust got the forerunner s it plays music but would have been nice to have an option to pay less for a non music version like on the forerunner  i would love a fr if i win btwdoes the training and coaching from the forerunner also carry through to the fenix and epix would love to have the garmin epix our household has a forerunner  and  and wed love to win a watch for an upgrade these models lack the fenix s capabilities and features and itd be a great upgrade to have the strength workout trackeri have an older foreruuner watch but i would be very interested in the forerunner  with amoled display and  the host of additional metrics as my ageing  plus years eyes would certainly appreciate the clearer brighter displayive started runningh with classic smart watches but  now i fallen in love with running and my old watches usually die during my long runsso dear santa i wish the forerunner  for my future university sport carrier and i would be finally able to sign myself for full marathon without excuses  psi would be the happies person on the world  thank you for helpfull videoi would love to give one of venue vivoactive forerunner or even fenix or epix to my girlfriend we always do all sorts of activities together kayaking hiking swimming she used to have a smartband which unfortunately broke down since then she doesnt have any fitness tracker she says that she will buy a garmin watch when she will be able to afford it but no luck so farbefore her smartband broke down she used to run a fair bit maybe not on a competitive level but it made her happy to see the progress right now she doesnt run at all she says she doesnt feel the motivation when she doesnt have a tangible visualization of her progress ive been using a fr since it was released and love it but ive had my eye on the epix pro gen for a while just really cant justify dropping kwould love the epic prothe forerunner s would be something for me as im heading for my second marathon yearive been thinking about an upgrade from my apple watch out of this lineup since i dont have to pay  its got to be the epix pro the amoled display the mapping features the multisport capabilities it just ticks all of the boxesim still using the apple watch se gen  but would love to be able to upgrade to the epix proi really like the sleep tracking on the vivo and the venue  but i think i like the enduro moreive never had a running watch before but ive destroyed a number of fitbits i think the forerunner  fits my needs well but all of them sound awesomei would choose like to be prized with a garmin   or fenix  solar because of these watches bright screen and navigation capabilities  i race in the  age category  this year ive set pbs at distances km km and  miles      ive been experimenting with triathlons in the last couple of years so a garmin  would be ideal      i love the out doors  skiing  once a year cycle and run regularly through the year and often go walkinghiking   ive also been known to roller blade  therefore a garmin fenix  solar would get well usedi currently use an apple watch to track runs but its not great at linking with strava for things like laps and splits im due to run miles in  days for charity in april and am considering a garmin as a more accurate tracker of distancepace etc which garmin do you suggest is best im an entry level runner on average normally run a couple of kms and a km a weekenduro  battery life wanna get back into running and think forerunner  will be the best option for mei love my fenix  pro but i would love to try the epix pro i want to see how the screen looks di would choose the best only its either epix gen  pro enduroheellow  andy and teamany forerunner series watchmay be  or  late again to an opportunity but it takes nothing to try i am not a pro  just a teenager have been running for  year but never more than  km until some days before when i completed my first k in arround minjust wanted an anchor  to keep me going the studies are getting hardersince i stared running again after becoming a mom via an super long ivf traject i really want to step up my game and use the forerunner  to be able to run k next yearid love to get the forerunner  i have a the venu  and i do kinna regret having the running specific features that forerunners haveive got the epix pro its has an ecg feature as well its onoy officially supported in us for now mainly due to needing regulatory approval but you can use a gps spoofer and a vpn to make garmin connect think you are in the us and you cam enable it with my mum having atrial fibrillation its a god send for me to be able to keep an eye on my heart rhythmthis was a very insightful video i would love the chance to win the forerunner i am to say the least big into running lol i currently just use the basic venu sq but looking to upgrade to the  or  mainly for the maps as i do a lot of longer runs on the trails at times but also hate taking my phone with to only check maps good video but sold the instinct short the instinct x has most of the features of the fenix x apart from colour screen and maps for half the pricefenix  pro sucker for that flashlight with the goal of running my first marathon in  a fore runner would be a great assetnicethe fenix  would be perfect as i am wanting to train for a sub  hopefully in berlin but if not elsewhere maybe in the uk somewhere then once that is done im gunna target utmb in the next  years max love my fr but wouldnt mind a fenix  pro i would love the forerunnner  to help get me back in shapeepix pro gen  will be great in my upcoming ultramarathon since this is amoled i can see it clearlythere is so much choice in the garmin range there really is a watch for everyone unfortunately i have multiple personalities so i still cant decide which watch is right for me would love the forerunner i would choose the garmin  because i have had a  for three years and i would like to upgrade to a similar watch with a better screenrelly difficult choice but if i had to have a new watch instead of my garmin  the the fenix x pro solar edition or the enduro  problerly will be first choicei like the looks of the more basic models  but i need buillt in gps so i would choose instinct i would love to have a garmin for runner  for my half marathon traininghope i get a chance to win onehello i am a triathlete i have never used a garmin watch i would like to maybe try and use the garmin fenix solar mm wish you all luck and goood runsthis is useful because there are just so many garmin watchesjust finish my k  minutes ago and got this video really interestingcurrently have the music and interested in the epix pro  enjoying how light the  is as i only take it off when i shower so im curious how comfortable the epix pro  is as a dailymy long term goal is to complete the occ during utmb week so the garmin enduro  would be the perfect training companion during my training towards that goal i hope to reach the goal in had an apple watch which broke last week would love the epix as a replacement that better suits my needscurrently running with a third hand forerunner  having damaged my  premium garmin watch so i would love the opportunity of getting a  to replace it just before christmasive recently started running again but i also love to go hiking and would therefore love to win the fenix s proid love to upgrade to a fenix pro or an epix pro my forerunner  is showing its age and is surprisingly limited in what mountain sports itll actually track started to run few months back and still looking out if i need a watch or notmaybe thats my chance to win one hhhwould love the epix gen bit out of my budget thoughi am actually a person that do so many sport in the day like outdoor running and hiking and indoor fitness and i am the kind of person that who doesnt charge his watch a lot i like garmin fenix im currently on my second garmin a  forerunner  its great for runs obviously but also hikes cycle and cardio i dont know anyone with a garmin who isnt impressed with itnot sure if the giveaway is still going on but i started running once my college soccer career came to an end and currently us the apple watch series  ive been looking into watches and really want a watch from the forerunner series preferably the  or  solar but just cant justify paying those prices on my college student money id be cool if the giveaway was still going on and maybe i won but none the less a great video and yall have inspired me more to get a new watch love the channel and i love runningafter many years of running and chasing the latest tech that i can afford ive had the xt the  and currently the fenix  i find the metrics on the fenix to be pretty unreliable as far as temperature altitude etc go to the point where ive had to learn to ignore them the temperature reading does tend to be about  degrees higher than actual so i can get a rough idea but when my watch tells me that i started my run at m below sea level and finished at m below sea level which is actually at the same place i cant hold any value to the information until i use strava to correct the readingsim really keen to get the  for the new screen better map navigation and all of the new metrics offered compared to the fenix  but im finding it very difficult to justify the price tag to my bank manager justifying it to myself is easy id love to win the  though im tempted to buy a  as its a bit cheaper and probably has enough features for me reallywould love a fenix  solar new to running and the garmin watch line appears to have more diversity then the average smart watch market has to offerhaving struggled with being overweight most of my life i started running ive done a k last year a half this year im booked into the new forest marathon next year thanks for the inspiration from your video and planning an ultra for my th in  the enduro  would really help currently using a fenix  which i love but like me its getting on a bit thanks for the video they are greatthe garmin s caught my eyes  especially after my  music has met its demisecurrently on apple series  not that much convinced because it got so many features that i dont use  i have had a look at the fnix  pro recentlyhi thx for the video but its still a tuff choice ultimately id like the enduro  but its a bit pricy and im not sure if ill ever run a  miler to really benefit from it then theres the fenix options and the  now if i was going fastpacking for say  days id defiantly take a power bank with me and being in norway i cant rely on sun so then the solar it not a benefit so im back to the cheaper brighter  as its got  hour gps and i can charge it at night with my power bank and its the most affordable onegreat breakdown of all the features ive had my eye on the forerunner  since it came out but i just cant justify spending that much money on myself i always end up buying the version thats being replaced to save a bit of cash such is the life of a teacherstudent ha day later edit i think watchingcommenting on this jinxed me just realized that the vivoactive  no longer keeps accurate time synced updated did all the things sighi love my fenix  pro would you love to upgrade but just cant justify the price  either way id be lost without it a venu small size sounds funi would love the fenix  pro solar saving up for one as i have  ultras planned for the comping year and my samsung galaxy watch  simply wont cut it pick me pick mei would love to have the epix pro gen  i would choose forerunner  i had a fitbit charge  but it broke now im swithcing to the vivoactive  for a couple reasons downloadable music screen price open water swimminglooking to upgrade my  year old   would be my go to if price wasnt a factor but  is more of a viable option for methe  is the sweet spot as a pure running watch good price  of the features no amoled nonsensebeing using the vivoactive s for the last  years it would be a great improvement to get a forerunner  i keep looking at the fenix x its the only one i can read without my glasses as long as i only have a maximum of  fields  my glasses steam up and i cant see a thing and i just cant use contacts bought a chest monitor in the sales to get most of the features of a new watch without buying a new watchis the fnix  goodi would love to upgrade my amazfit to an epix been eying up garmins for agesrunningchannel where was the

phone to see which will fail first i need the cleansing fire and new beginnings of the fenix  pro to bring new life to my running journeyforerunner  was the one i wanted to get if i did have unlimited cash i prefer using the buttons in most cases as touch screens tend to have issues during the rain which i why i prefer the forerunner range which have a touch screen on the higher end ones as a extrain your opinion which is the best for someone who goes to the gym and does hiiti am looking for a new watch for a long time now and have my eyes as a runner on the forerunner  because of the amoled screen the battery life and the light weight for me the maps feature in the  isnt importanteven a serious athlete doesnt really need to look beyond the forerunner  for a high quality athlete

amoled qui me ferait penser  une apple watchi would love a  been ogling them for months in the hope i can one day afford one started running when i became widowed as a way of dealing with emotions and headspace and not stopped not fast or particularly good but the mental health benefits far excel any medication ive never had a garmin before i want a forerunner  but in indonesia it costs around ten million rupiah very unaffordable for me ahahaha some day i will upgrade to a fenix proi would like to win the epix pro d bigger is betterstrokecant afford those watch so were all picking the enduro righti may be a sinner but make me a winnerthis is why i cant buy into garmin  the range of models is absurdconfusingunclear its quite incredible that garmins own website doesnt include filtering for battery life running type eg want to do just short runs or ultras etcmy daughters name is lilly i can only pick lily sporti must admit i love the running channel but i feel these garminrelated videos watch like pure infomercials i recognize how sponsored content is often necessary but these often present as purely adds for a company and not sincere running channel contentim pretty sure its called venus instead of venuegreat review but the side camera view is off putting your presentation when looking directly at us is great side view seems like youve forgetten you have an audience no offense intended i just find it odd im curious to know why presenters do thislove your chanel great fibe definately keep up the positivity  as an outdoor lover really like the enduro or epix gen x with my kids having something indeatructable is definately a added bonusjust buy the cheapest one and then every year update to a more expensive model till you reach the top just like i did i want a watch man pleaseyou need to have a word with the person who chooses your title pic  oi guv wanna buy a cheap running watch only one careful ownercant run anymorereal bargainrunningchannel was this draw to win a garmin done yetwhat about apple watchcomment to winwhich youtube expert decided a b roll camera looking a face thats not looking at it was a great idea by any chance were they from a camera company just find it so distractingduring any given amazing run in any given beautiful space im sick of getting my already batterytired phone out of my sad little waist bag fumbling around with the passcode as i slow down to a short and lustless limp i eventually give in stop and for the first time in a while notice myself trying to catch my breath as i successfully enter fort knox and as quickly as possible do whatever it is that has required me to stop  check my pace distance heart rate where im heading to what on earth i am doing at the top of this hill reply to my partner worry about something else take a picture oh i may as well take a video as well reply to the reply from my partner yes i will pick up dinner check a recipe online go on then ill check the news as well oh god oh god oh god one more photo another check of the route because ive forgotten by now worry about how my average pace is being affected wow look at the time struggling to do so in the corner of my wet phone screen and realise that i better get moving again because i havent felt my feet for a while after taking stock of the preview of emails that will worry me for the rest of my run i slide my soggy phone back into my belt trap the ties on my shorts in the zip take my gloves off in order to fix the problem and finally do the awkward lunge of setting off once again with my heart and lungs finding it difficult to keep up as they had assumed they were in phone scrolling mode would you believe it ive forgotten where im going again and after one more stop  phones dead i guess my partner will be worrying for the next few hours and ill be getting lostor i could simply glance at my wrist and my forerunner  keeping moving as i do all of the essentials with ease and poise and not being distracted by anything else that can wait until im back at the car the route to which is beautifully communicated to me via my lovely watch glistening with dignity in the onslaught of british rainand sometimes i guess i wont mind getting my phone out for that must have photo along the way wow  battery still thanks garmilnwho won the giveaway why arent you being transparent about iti dont have garminafter using the apple watch for awhile now i am itching to have more advanced metrics the forerunner  looks like a good in between for the pro features without going too crazy with all the added navigation features that i probably cant use in the cityim guessing garmin didnt send you any of the marq series cheapskates or dont bother with garmin and get a sunnto or coros much better sports watches at better pricesgarmin has too many watches they all tell time and have gps venu vivoactive fenix epix forerunner instinct just a stupid company they need to simplify their offeringsinstead of  they

with menusim on the hunt for my first garmin and have been doing research on several models appreciate your honest reviewhey shervin great video just wanted to mention that the track run mode on garmin watches isnt based on maps it learns the track after the first run after the first run it should be an almost perfect ovaldiscovered your channel recently im literally watching all your videos such a great contenthaving a forerunner  since  days im already watching the reviews of higher specs model and yours are very interestinglast weekend i went hiking on a volcano with my son as the evening approached a heavy fog rolled in and i could literally only see one meter ahead im not sure if i would have been able to find my way back but fortunately i used the option to return to the starting point it was reassuring to have topographic maps a bright screen excellent gps multiband and above all a battery that wouldnt leave me stranded during the hike i know that fenix or epix are more suitable for this kind of activity but to be honest i think this watch does it all the only difference is that it has a less robust body but is lighter and happy to have  saved in my wallet  everyone weighs their priorities differently greetings and great videoi have been running for years and i finally have been looking for a high quality running watch thanks for the video bro i am gonna order one nowthank you for all you do reviews are great content is great keep it upthis bloke needs more views production quality is always on point top g level of video quality and interesting testsokay that top left segment indicator next levelnice video and analysis great job mategreat piece of advice in the conclude part of the videoi completely agree with you i am on my second garmin x they charge you  to replace it after warranty is up only been two years need to take this into account when purchasing future garmin productsgood video thank you i would note too that garmin watches hold up a long time as do apple products to be fair im an huge android fan in the last  plus years im only on my nd garmin watch i forgot the first model but my  still lasts weeks without needing to be charged i bought it refurbished but my work is offering a health incentive so i can actually look at new watches an hr wrist based watch with storage for musicaudiobooks so i dont have to run with my phone sounds great built in golf tracking and a tracking map when i go hunting so i dont get lost i definitely think ill go with the awesome review thank you i will be purchasing the watch after thisthankyou for these videos really well done review awesome video as always  one question i have is you mention apple health is your main health app that catches all data  what if you do a run on apple watch do you some how get that loaded on garmin connect to keep your training status updated or your not to concerned with connect   thankshave you done a video of the epix  pro vs  curious what your experience is also if you could emphasise which model of the pro vsvs great average fitness person review thinking about the  for the screen i dont do iron mans or ultra marathons just gym and bike a little and i have the forerunner  for the battery life and dont use my apple watch  as its just one more thing to charge everyday i would get apple watch ultra but i always have my phone so theres no benefit for me like your channel keep up the good worki like the body battery its kinda nice to see the number and correlate it to how my day is its pretty accurate but its cool to see itim between forerunner  and a fenix  solar or sapphireim using it to trailruntrainlift in prep for spartan beast as well as being able to know where i am miles wise when doing the beast also an avid backpacker but i already have an in reach since you own both of these which would you recommend i buy price wise the  is only  cheaperi dont know if id be using all the other functions of the fenix but i do weightlifting religiously so not sure if the activity tracking for fenix is better than the  in terms of looking at life after my spartan racemostly do cycling and brisk walking would this be a good watch im torn between this and the instinct x love the ruggedness and solar of instinct x but i also love the features of fir music controls there is an automatic shortcut just hold the down button from there you can easily pauseplay skip an extra  clicks allows you to adjust volumethank you so much for this lots of my friends recommended the forerunner  to me however my apple watch is still okay im not a professional athlete so the apple watch suffices for my needs just thinking about running a marathon when it comes to battery life i have to admit that the apple watch only lasts until  kilometers while listening to music and podcastsyou can customize hotkeys to whatever you like including music player super easy to do surpirse you did not mention thatbest watch ive used for many years and i have used a lot fenix   pro epix  fenix x apex  pro pace  awu awi dont like texts calls notifications etc on my watches just use purely for sports and wear daily its pretty much perfect for mei wanted a garmin because i have been using the vivoactive  for a while i went with the galaxy watch  and am missing the battery life but i love the other features of the watch  i may splurge for my birthday and get another garmin anywayexcellent video shervin as an awu primary user i actually just ordered a  a few days ago it should be here next week love your insight because i think were on the same wavelength on all the topics ive yet to purchase a garmin that ive kept for longer than the return period actually i believe i kept and later sold the it always comes back to the awu for me but im an oncall nurse and dad so having lte without my phone is crucial i hate to say it but  im already suspecting the  will go back ill give it an honest try thoughinteresting i have rarely ever had to manually import things into strava from my apple watch ultra workouts runs walks have always auto imported for mejust got the watch  normally a just use strava on my iphone went on a mile run today but the watch was mins slower than my phone  so baffled a bit to know whats  more accuratestress and body battery scores are underrated features on the garmin watches i hear a lot about the sleep scores as being important which it is i suppose although i dont use it the body battery is very helpful info the body battery is a byproduct of all the other stuff i supposeawesome reviewthe goat speaks  i actually use the instict solar that thing is rugged own a forerunner  but i only use it on intense training sessions to grab training performance data i cant get from the instinct solar to be honest with you all of these garmin watches do the exact same basic things and theyre essentially bike computers on the wristplease tell me i have ordered garmin   forerunner on amazon s it goodhow would you compare this to the fenix s pro solar i upgraded back in april to the fenix from the forerunner  and the battery life on the fenix is absolutely horrendousyou can just download your workout playlist then use a wireless earbud and most decent earbuds can skip songs etc its pretty much a perfect watch for sports not smart watch and garmin pay accepts curve which can have any card and is free just get a free curve account and add it to your watch and add any card you want to your curve account bit of a workaround but easy to do and you only have to do it oncei was in the apple shop the other day  looked at the awu whilst browsing and its  no comparison to my  epix gen  sapphiredoes the watch have acrued time so you get a break down of per mile also with the combined time of  miles  miles  miles to what ever distance u runfunny how many people actually dont like loading mps onto their watch i have the fitbit ionic for this very reason that and the gps maybe i am just old but i am looking at getting a garmin since fitbit recalled my watch i dont wanna have to carry my phone while exercising so having everything on the wrist is nicemaybe  the garmin didnt trace right because the rotation of the earth idk just a thoughtfrictionless  yep certainly less friction its why i bought the apple even though i wanted the garminone of the big differences between the  and the  is mapping  but you can easily add maps to the  with an app like mappily for not very much money might be worth a look if youre on the fence about which to go forwhat city is thisyou should be at a million followers soon enoughliked the reviewone thing you should be aware of more in terms of comparison than anything else is there are countries such as her in ireland where carriers dont support esim so the advantages of the apple watch ultra fall away   you still need a phone with you for cell service etc to respond to texts to download from spotify   so when you take that away from the apple watch it becomes an average fitness watch with appalling battery life and the garmin is streets aheadim looking at either getting the garmin fenix  pro or the forerunner  i want something that will be good for occasional backpacking with no service with a good battery life but is also great for everyday wear and running with great navigation is the  good for all of these things or should i go with the fenix  proi regularly use and look at the stats that garmin provides those are the biggest reason i use it more than my apple watch ultra as well you dont need to down load apps and pay for damn subscriptions to get the data that the device can provide id argue that the first best way of controlling your music while youre running is through buttonssliderswhatever on your headphones its much more convenient to double press a button on my shokz for next song or change the volume there than fiddling on my watch or even phonejust bought it and now sent it back  the price is insane should be half that costtenho p xt e por enquanto est timo tenho todas funes que precisozrl is just tuesdays unfortunatelyfortunately they are the biggest name in the game so the best teams show up theres a few other seriesleagues happening but not with the same team dynamics one day ill have to jump in with you on the tiny racesgreat another watch comparison reviewany negative experiences with the hr or sleep tracking from the quantified scientists testing they didnt seem accuratenot correct about apple workout app not uploading directly to strava the workout app will upload straight to strava you just hit save on the run in the workout app and it uploads to strava depending on whether u have cellular or not it may need to be near your phone to do this thoughhave you ever tested the polar pacer pro if so what are your thoughts on itwould like to see your daily diettrack mode on apple watch is great in the us nowhere near as accurate internationally hrv stress load are useful for multisport when you have to stack the workouts  workouts a week not just runningdo u think the traning readiness and training effect worth it if i do most workout inside gym should i get the venu  or i have an apple watch and it syncs automatically with strava when i finish a runi wanted the  then the epix came out thats what i went withim debating the  vs  leaning towards the the body battery and stress monitoring features on garmin are quite impressivestress monitoring which utilizes heart rate variability hrv enables you to understand many situations where you might not have realized your body was undergoing stress with this information you can take appropriate actions maybe im being overly dramatic but i believe its a lifechanging featuregarmin also has the body battery feature which compiles all the data from the watch to give you a rough idea of your limits and the extent to which an event like a workout or stress impacts your body it also helps you understand aspects like sleep debt and moreon the other hand apple is quite limited in these respects i say this after toy around with an apple watch series  youll need to use additional apps to achieve something similar and as far as i can tell the apple watch doesnt collect hrv data as frequently as garmin does consequently the stress monitoring feature will have far fewer data points on an apple watch than on a garmin which will lead to a less acture stress picturethis dude runs with  watches on my takeaway is to get   plus watches in order to get the best smartwatch experience and wear them all simultaneously lolive spent two years trying to find one watch to rule them all truth is there isnt smartwatches that look cool dont have the features i need and are crazy expensive plus they have features that interrupt my workouts and training and the ones that do exactly what i need are style free soulless and sterile pieces of plastic and siliconehave you tried the garmin instinct is this a mmboth  and  track triathlon and cloth does not dry better than siliconeim not a runner at all im doing cycling more and the usual things that humans do between the newest apple watch series  that will be out or a  that i think will fulfill my needs what do i choose  i have one shoot at this i have a series  but its old busted and the battery doesnt hold me enough so that i can be stress free and just roll without caring about my apple watch i have to change this year with one of the two so i take apple watch newer generation or i change course and take for the first time garmin   im afraid to be let down disappointed by garmin and wanting to get back to the apple watch  tough one for meinstinct  solar for memy issue is how disconnected the garmin ecosystem is some stuff you have to do on the watch some in the mobile app and then some in the web app very annoying and garmin does not listen to users requests there are simple features such as calendar updates which have been requested for  years and they just ignore ushow come a silicon band dry slower than a nylon onewill this watch work for a walker  miles  per week or is this watch just specifically for runners onlyhello guys this  have spotifyapple fan boy for sureee  no hate thoughits great watch im getting it instead of another aw unfortunately its damn hard to get in uk   weeks shipping time if you hold down the bottom right button during a workout it takes you to the music settings its not that hardif you crave a smartwatch over a dedicated fitness watch it imply that you are lacking in fitness or not fit enoughyou can turn training status off when youre not training so you dont get those sad updates hahnif you hold the down button you can get to your music fastyou look like keeganmichael keytrack running today start  stop saveactivity on watch on garmin connect just a move iq nothing elseeverything else sync ok i start to regret buying this productgood inforeview but you talk way too fast for me with  rikkiive come to a conclusion with garmin they are parttime watches good for one thing with no esims they will always be second to apple watch and galaxy watches  from the enduro k to the  solar  no esims or true lte they will never accommodate the every day common person loved the  solar and instinct x solar but my gwpro always wins no matter how good the hr sensor is on garmins  mip displays  with true solar charge is where its at  great reviewdo people still consider others perception when making purchasing decisionsdid a k and a k with my apple watch guess im not that serioussilicone drys faster than cloth so much wrong information in this video learn how to use the watch correctly before saying you cant do this or that if you wear an apple watch you arent serious about fitnessi didnt watch but i did buy  just joking but tired of kids titles dont buy until you watch this cmon grow up that is for kids to lure themi swear this guy is the worst fitness trackers reviewer everthe  is totally worth it  i prefer it over the ultrashervin we know you love that apple watch but you keep getting really simple things wrong in these garmin reviews show the love with some easy fixesstress and body battery are used to help determine your training readiness from garmin and the morning run down is part of that stress can also help peopel realize the things they do to hold back training drinking alcohol eating too much so on as they will see the stress spike and it helps people learn what is bad for them body battery is a great indicator of sleep stress and readiness morning routine has rolled out to almost every garmin device and is well recived but you cna check the stats with garmin on that  these are also built in you do not need a rd party app that you have ot pay for to track these things smartwatch features you can access the music by pressing a single button bottom left and it will let you control volume and going back or forward you can connect spotify and it will download a playlist same thing apple offers for offline music on non lte devicesfor the dozenth time  garmin pay is on there it is contactless payments i have an amex platinum and a chase saphire card on there it works anywhere apple pay works you got this there are ways to fix every problem you have brought up you talk about how you have ot optimize the apple watch to work best for you same goes for any serious garmin user i have an apple watch ultra and a fenix x pro i wear the fenix full time waiting for the apple watch os update and possibly a new ultra that supports ant otherwise i cant take it seriously as a workout device for a cyclistis there a way to count jumps jump rope workout in fri would go with  or instinct great review thankshi just want to know between venu  plus and forerunner  which one have longer battery lifewhen i go a easy run that is my current k pb is  so my easy pace is around  to   so when i do the easy runs in these paces then my garmin says the heart rate above aerobic zoneso is it good or garmin say wrongwhy are you screamingi have had forerunner  and  this month and just ordered the  today forerunner  has a nicer screen compared to  however i have noticed a consistent delay when accessing workout statistics and sometimes when switching back to the watch face from the menu this could be due to the fact that the processor in the forerunner  is the same as in the forerunner  potentially having difficulties in rendering more pixels and silly animations because i never experience this with  the  battery life lasts around  days with alwayson enabled and about  days without iti discovered that the fenix watches are heavy on wrist cold when minus degrees bad light and bad vibration i would go woth a forerunner  music or something like that insteadthank younice videonice video the watch at  i cant find that color way anywhere which is itnicecan anyone tell me which garmin watch has animated workouts  list of all watches which has animated workouts waitinghi everyone good review here is my like my vote goes to forerunner  a nice weekend for everyone yes whyfenix  didnt make the listinstinct if you have tattoo on your watch wearing hand dont buy a new garmin before you try if the wrist heart rate sensor works first  otherwise u can end up with a new and improved sports watch which you can wear only on your untattood handthanks dude you helped me choose my g shock now youre helping me with my garmin garmin venu  does it for mefenix  enduro  super incomplete videowhy do smart watches have music storage do they have speakers or headphone jacks why not just use your phone for musichey man lower your voiceiphone compatiblecan you type texts from any of these watches not interested in voice onlyjesus calm down i had to turn the video off why are you shouting down the micpainmate are you also ai its getting hard to tell after so many best  garmin videosthe winner is huaweiare the better than the apple watch garmin is not a health tracker at all it says im sleeping when im watching tv and then going to the toilet before actually going asleep  furthermore it misses hr by bpm compared to polar hif you like this video youll love our new podcast weve extended our yearend chats to a regular ongoing podcast where we chat about all things sports tech including smartwatches sportswatches bike computers bike trainers trainer apps and anything sports tech related  httpswwwyoutubecomthefitfileyou guys need to do an awards episode  best of the year  best value  best running  fitness  best smartwatch  best battery life  etcdang almost  hours long gotta get the popcorn  garmin should have a tradeup program to foster loyalty and buying without  year gapsthis is fast becoming a private christmas party for my adventure watch guilty pleasure thanks for all the hard work this was funthis video is extremely helpfull it saves me at least  hours watching different channels of reviewing smartwatchesthe fr getting a sapphire screen would be fantastic i long stayed in the fenix family but recently pulled the trigger on the  its a fantastic device but i admittedly was apprehensive about how the screen would hold up after spending years with a sapphire screen so far so good i love how much lighter it is less bezel more amoled screenglad to see suunto finally upping their game and being competitive again in the market on all aspects going from software features price and as usual their gps accuracy hope to see more great things again from them next yearone of the best days of the year completely agree with you both on garmin and their completely broken model naming i consider myself to be reasonably up to date on sports tech but the whole epix vs fenix thing with various suffixes just leaves me scratching my head in my head because of the different names im deeply suspicious that somewhere in the menus therell be a crucial missing feature if only the display is different lets have fenix  and fenix  amoled and then its clear great work guys just another  minutes to go yall are the real deal even though i ended up finally pulling the trigger on the x pro because of a great sale of  and your reviews i still have to watch this  thanks for all yalls hard work and help with my decision i couldnt be happier for my gym workouts and health tracking coming from a galaxy watch  classic really awesome overview  love the insights you guys bring  thanks for everything you do to give the community the best information out thereso first of all thank you your genuine friendship is inspiring will watch all your videos in  as wellnext garmin really needs to repair their naming convention they should state clearly the entry level the mid level and the flagship plus enough with the proplusetcits a lovely video keep it up guys i agree with the naming strategy it should become simpler i have the enduro nd gen which i believe should be merged with the fenix unless they will release an enduro  with amoled solar charging and whatnot to make battery life more amazing than it isif garmin could add cellular capabilities for messaging and calls as well as strong vibrationstones for notifications that could match apple watch then it would be a no brainer for me instead of being stuck on the fence between full blown smart watch or full blown fitness watchvery cool you both collaborate would love to see you each speak with product managers from garmin casio citizen and apple about the convergence of fashion watches and fitness trackersalways great to hear you guys i wish you gave the rest watches the review you gave polar v great videogarmins next versions of the crossover and instinct x are probably going to be the next devices ill be interested in i was sooooo close to pulling the trigger on both at different times of we were looking forward to thisdc rainmaker and desfit in one watch test thats an blockbuster  a litte bit like the expendables thank you guys for he whole year and see you in many more reviewsthank you for doing this i just bought my first garmin watch today  vivoactive hello des and rayit is nice to see you guys togheter again also nice to see new brands  like mobvoi units being included on the review my brand is suunto and currently own a  baro unit and may be upgrading next year not a real fan of amoled displays but mips are my thing more discrete and power saving devices huawei and amazfit are getting more sport units and less smart watches devices samsung and xiaomi maybe cheers from mxico keep up the good work happy holidays peacefinally got a chance to sit down and watch this fantastic i always look forward to this each year      love iti genuinely look forward to this every yearthanks guys i watched countless hours of both of your channels to decide which garmin watch was right for me epix pro  lets just get rid of the gen as mentioned in the video ftw love itas a garmin instinct  user i really wanted an epix  or fenix  but they are just soooooooo expensive i ended up picking up a amazfit trex  instead that will have to do for nownice review currently im using apple watch  for the functionality and an amazfit bip  for when i want  weeks without charging a great combo for my needs for using with my android phone the watch that tempts me most is the vivoactive  and having had the vivoactive  its great seeing the vivoactive name coming backi currently use the samsung watch  pro and what keeps me in the samsung family is really decent tradeins  i got  for my watch   id highly suggest garmin institute the same business practice create brand loyalty and show recycling consciencegreat job i really enjoy these thanksamazing stream thanks guys ive had my dive watchcomputer for about  yrs and almost the same with my fenixx which was latest  greatest at the time its fantastic that now i can combine the two witout compromise on either in  i am holding the trigger til my next dive trip as both units are still working very well except for thr diminished battery time on the garmin but after all these years of hard use i am impressed it still works disappointed to see the charge type has not changed since xi just brought the garmin tactix amoled and iys awesome a very solid watch with that amoled display and hardware and so on its my ideal watchtotally agree on the features vs price level on the garmin watches garmin did something similar with the  when the  was released at a lower price it had some more advanced features not hardware related that were never added to the  i liked my  very much but garmin totally discarded the buyers of the watchmy experience with the   venu  comparison was exactly what ray commented on  in the end i threw my hands in the air and upgraded my apple watch  the venu  with training readinesstraining load features would have been an easy buy for mei am loving my fr  i use it for fitness running indoor rowing hiking and motorcycling it does everything i need and want it to do and it is very comfortable to wear with the nylon strapso good thank youthank you guys really love this reviewcongrats on this and nailing the piece around garmin naming while discussing the fenix and epic  ive been researching for months and had no idea up to now of how garmin organises their models and naming convention heres something crazy considering im stepping up to the km ultra marathon distance this year because of the million models of garmin which i just cant work out im going for a coros or an apple watch ultra  and likely the latter as im wary of coros that is crazy honestly ive been things to be doing than working out the multitude of garmin modelsalso my crazy wish a double width apple watch ultra  amazing for mapping and im willing to bet it comes in around the same weight as a fenixepix itll never happen awesome review thanks guysi would love to see a new suunto  google wear smartsports watch i have to say that was one of my favorite watches for a mostly smartwatch user who likes the ruggedsporty designguys i have spent the last  months reviewing options to replace my apple watch series  with a focus on health fitness and outdoor activities i was all over the garmin map no pun intended i dont need phone capabilities so i ended up with the fenix  pro solar reconditioned with all your info on both your channels i am confident about the choice for me i just want to say thank youcant wait for your guys descent mk review very curious on why they put the old heart rate sensor on it instead of the latest one yes i was waiting for this another fantastic annual overview des  ray thanxunfortunately i was ultimately unable to attend the morning run or visit the cave hopefully we will meet again next yearsuggestion would also like to see an annual review of accessories as well such as the whoop band stryd oura ring  i have one of the bands  it takes some time probably a few months but it broke in to a point where its comfortable but it is still stiff i can tell you now that its comfortable on the size that i always wear it on and if i had to change it i would notice it because of how stiff the band it saying that i like to wear a silicone band when i run or swim as its easier to clean and dry but i often forget to switch it because of how comfy this band is now its also really hard wearing which for the intended use and what i use it for is keyyou guys really spoke to my struggle the s and the venu s are so close and yet so vexxing i had both and yet i wanted to settle on one but i miss my training features when im wearing the venu s yet the neat little notes after training that you get with the venu  is nice as well plus the touchscreen interface on the venu  while adding in information aaaaaaggghhh so what do i pick the microphone and speaker or the beloved training features that i have coveted since vivoactive heart or whatever that ugly thing was called accidentatlly had training effect for  weeks before it was deactivated sighmy mm epix pro is imo the best athletic watch in existence todaygreat video guys  especially last seconds of it ive worn the forerunner and then fenixtactix series always the large versions for years and picked up the epix pro sapphire mm this year particularly due to the battery life while the epix pro mm equals or betters the fenix  pro in battery life with alwayson turned off there is still the gap of course with it turned on although  days life is incredible i am interested to see whether garmin somehow merges the fenix and enduro lines and comes up with a mips model with even better battery life or whether they focus on improving amoled battery life and eventually drop the mips watches altogether it would be neat to see an enduro  with updated hr sensor and betterthanfenix  pro battery lifeon a completely different note it would be amazing to see a fenix or epix watch that squarely took on apple by finally including lte functionality andor standalone inreach capabilityfor a nongarmin device the amazfit balance was a great surprise one of the first more accurate amazfit watches but i would still advice most to pay  extra and get a real garminlove your channel and i enjoy both of you guyz channels very informative and really to be honest the best place to get a review of any snart watch so whats your favourite watchas in which tops them all these videos every yearmy x pro with the better mip screen has been almost perfect if they didnt update it would of gone with the epix prodo you think garmin is going to do anything more with ltethey seem to have released the lte then just gave up on ithello guys thank you very much for this great review i have a question what is your recommendation for a watch that is good for fitness hr and tracking sleep not necessary a smartwatch i rarely use my phone actually  thank you so much guys for always sharing your knowledge another great  videothank you guys great video thanks a lotappreciate the video  thanksgreat review thanksthanks for this videothe tactix band which i use for my x is the most comfortable band once you break it in it also adds style to the x tacticalwow i didnt know you guys did these how cooli have two of the tactical nylon straps that i use with my fenix x  one of them i have had since the x i have the original black on and a coyote tan one they are stiffer than i would prefer and do not really soften but they do mold to your wrist over a few days after that point the stiffness is fairly irrelevantthe end that sticks into the keeper loops frays a bit over time and you need to apply a match or lighter to remelt every several months of daily wear to keep them nice other than cosmetic touchup by melting the bands themselves are nearly indestructiblei use the nylon strap for x daily wear when not actually working out i find that this is good for me in tropical environments to prevent developing a rash or ringworm under the strap because they breath and i am have somewhat of a tendency to rashes under the watch band i like these bands but my review is mixedhey gentsi truly appreciate your videos on youtube i have watched your videos and others on epix pro v fenix x pro battery and amoled screen difference im still conflicted on whether the epix pro battery in a smartwatch mode can last me a full marathon and km my longest distances happy to hear your thoughts thanksafter weeks of consideration and watching numerous sportwatch reviews i decided to buy the coros pace  i love its longlasting battery features and frequent updates that add more features making early reviews less relevantive become a huge fnix fan from the original now rocking the  waiting for the newest pros to get cheaper it will be sad to see such an iconic name to go away but this is me just being a fan boy of this watchtwo of my favorite creatorsthanks for your video youre amazingi look forward to this all year do either of you review the withings scanwatch novabest collab after so many years for as long as i can remember i have always used garmin but honestly acquiring gps signal takes so long sometimes more than like  minutes updating older models is just non existent i have the enduro  and its like they have forgotten about it it was flagship watch and just no new features or anything they can easily implement alot of features but yeah i will be switching to either coros or suuntowhat about surfing with the forerunner   i love the larger screen and slimmer base on it vs the epixanother fantastic review from you and des im curious though other than just being better at something whether its heart rate data gps or whateverwhat else is out there that has become the carrot to chase which nobody or hardly anyone has done up to this point with all the stuff these things can do im just wondering what is left other than maybe lte for all fitness watcheswhich is the best for cyclocrossmust have power and hr compatibilitya  solar with sapphirewamoled would be an immediate buy for me as an upgrade to my  ltevendors add features so spec comparisons look good trouble is many features are shallow and useless but the buyer learns this too late thank you for helping us know which features meet our needs and actually work as expectedi have just brought a suunto race watch black so what yall think amoled or mip display wanting to get into a higher end watch like a  or  for running xc skiing fitness and smartwatch featuresi like a big readable screen but is it possible to set the  always on while doing activitythank you guys for the video very insightful i am struggling to find a garmin that works for me because of the battery life i play badminton and swim on regular basis i also hike and go out fishing in the summer i prefer light weight watch and i am not a pro of any of these activities any advice instinct xnice review huawei watch gt my original commentaries x  were longer but i think were deletedhave this year finally replaced my old fr i was very much a beginner runner so my decision at the time was between that and the fr with a fenix x pro as im now going past hm to marathons and ultrasagree that the x basically made the enduro moot as until the pro came out i was wavering between the fenix x and the enduro  as for the next epix could that solve both the epix naming issues the amoled fenix confusion by just being called the fenixgood selectionhelp please so should i get epixpro now for christmas or wait for the next revision i have a  its okay just getting oldmy christmas wishlist would be a  an epix that has inreach capabilitieshope that polar will come with some major updates for vantage v to make it more competitivewhats the best bang for buck as a back up standby watch in the garmin eco system i run a tactix daily but thinking the garmin swim i do a lot of swimming as i can carry on when i send it backi am a large guy so bigger is better and i nearly bought the epix in the black friday sale great walk through on all of these on the garmin fenix  pro and epix if they are essentially the same watch just one has an amoled display is the  price difference and significantly reduced battery life worth it for someone whose primary activities with it will be walking and hikingas a current spix usernif i was buying again id go for the fenix  pro the amoled screen on the epix is nice but only makes a difference for maps which is used very infrequently the febix has the better battery life and solar both of which would be benefitted from daily  splitting hairs really as both are top of the pile in my opinion but for iutdoor endurance events thenfenix nakes more sense as the mip screen is also better in sunlight than the amoled anywaythis one is must watch im waiting more than apple wwdc thank you again this year for this videoat this time i could get a fenix  pro solar or instinct x which do you think is better ive used a st gen instinct as my edc for years and love it i actually bought a x back in dec but sent it back as i had just purchased a rangeman gshock and just didnt want to hear it from the wife  anyways thoughts on the x vs femix  if they were the same pricewjat do you thnink get an epix pro gen  or wait few months for a major update epix gen its a pity that you havent tested amazfit balance im curious about your opinion on it i hope you will record something else about this watch soondess sapphire option on the forerunner xx series is a good one id buy it id also like to see better smartwatch features such as improvements to both textemail handling and turnbyturn google maps navigation plus the latest hr sensor of coursenice review as always why dont you add huawei also on the suunto watches can they do updates to improve the heart rate sensor and to the maps so that they have a little more detail like street nameshuwaei gt prices  and garmin instinct   standard for  among these  watches which is compatible for i phone and accurate health monitoringwould you buy the vivoactive  or epix gen  i can get epix gen for  or vivo  for  i really only want it for weight training and sleep coachi am not an operator but i think the tactix with amoled will be marketed at the nonmilitary tacticool market that want the look but dont need the actual security featuredoes polar h work with samsung healthfenix  pro looks so greatas a garmin fanboy i wonder what new hardware features are being developed for the fenix  i seriously doubt that glucose or bp measuring are there yet so that would leave them with new design and possibly a new charging portwireless charging i guess we will seei have an apple watch se and i still enjoy it i just wish the battery life was a bit closer to what garmin puts out the apple watch ultra looks awesome but i have the wrist of a small teenager so it would look bad on me i dont like to usually go more than  on lug to lugi think sleeper watch of  is garmin  you get all the metrics and dual band gps great battery life and price now is unbeatable for what you getcan either of you vouch for a particular watch that excels at measuring calories burned both for workouts and the everyday life onesits this time of the year alteady time sure flies fastjust bought the fenix x pro sapphire solar on amazon for  usd brand new i couldnt pass up that deal  i wonder how big of an upgrade itll be from my venu when is your longterm review of the suunto vertical coming out been waiting for it for ages and any spoilers about it you want to share i am on the fence about keeping mine or swap to apex  pro thank you for making such a wonderful video dc rainmaker hi ray i observe that you are wearing the whoop strap in most of your videos and indeed i have been using it since its founding days after watching your review and comparing it with other standard heart rate monitors i dont find it accurate please tell me if the accuracy has improved or the reason why you wear it consistently i find their pricing model highly unjustifiable especially after watching your review i would deeply appreciate your feedback in this matterwhat is the best multi sport watch for performance and recovery i mainly do soccer k m sprints functional training  i want to track my metrics and my recovery  any recommendations what the best watch is ive always used a polar vantage and recently apple watch  any new suggestions peopleperhaps well see a garmin fenixepix crossover maybe in the form of a marq  thank you for this review do you know that in suunto race you can store   races only for a go or  go watch this is  very low in addition this watch is not compatible with komoot pity because the other characteristics of this watch are fine and the watch is easy to usefor me the ideal watch size range is maximum mm if its more than that it will be very strange its like putting a wall clock on your hand unfortunately polar seems to be loosing the momentum i transferred from my polar vantage v to the garmin  after years of being a polar fan since their usb connection to their polar trainer pc software years ago i would think that polar would have something to expand on their fitness testing and recovery programsgreat video but i was hoping to see at the end what you would buy at different price pointsif i could have any garmin it would be that forged carbon looks sweet price is insane though i wonder how much it costs for them to produce one of themwhat would you recommend between the two forerunner  or forerunner yep more battery life for my ultra pleasedid you set the samsung  hr on measure continous reading only its not set up out of the box to do thatto me there is one limitation of amoled that negates it for me i want to use my watch as an always on bike computer straped to my handlebar for long rides on my road bike therefore mip is my only option i dont understand why this is not a bigger thing in amoled watch reviews i dont want to reach for my watch every  secs to turn on the backlightit seems to appear the fitbit charge  is still having major issues like the charge  reading fitbits community board you can tell google and fitbit werent on the same page as mentioned in the videoimagine garmin manage to combine the transflextif display with the amoled as a former operator can confirm  the percentage of actual military professionals wearing pieces like this rounded to the nearest percent is zeroyou tend to find forerunner series looks and lightweight and instinct series disgusting battery life on the wrists of actual operators  night vision zeroize applied ballistics and jumpmaster features are just marketing for tactical bros  solid wrap up guys  see you all next yearyear in review video already where did days go time to work and watchlisten to this video rays wrists are so white d reminds me of my own left wrist during the summer btw how do you guys know each other friends from before yt or trough influencer world di bought a venu  based on your reviewsin my country it was much cheaper than fr now let me ask you this if i put one of those plasticrugged cases to protect it will it affect the accuracyim looking for a good recommendation for a hiking watchso glad the fenixepixenduro naming conventions got discussed what a messit would be nice if garmin helped explain some of the differences between the watches the fact that they try to make the instinct x just seem like a larger model of the instinct  is so dumb garmin just makes it all so confusing i bought an instinct  solar a few months agocan you push next time the pixel watch team to include more things like interval training for running next timedo you think that blood pressure will become a feature i think only samsung has that so fargarmin really jumped on the solar side w their bike computers and the fenix  solar wondering if other companies will move that waymay i know what phones do you guys use the hostsi watched till the end waiting for you guys to tell us which ones are your personal best this yearwhat is some of your top rated watches we would love to see your top picks for budget running hiking smartwatch ectim most concerned about heart rate tracking and diversity of workout types tracking not just runningim not loyal to garmin but garmin just keeps putting out watches that cover all the bases would have loved me a coros pace  or a suunto vertical or even a polar vantage v i need ant along with bluetooth sensor compatibility then garmin also is implementing the offline maps better than anyone then you have the music both mp and deezer spotify amazon anything out there other than garmin thats better than my forerruner  im not an amoled display guy nothing to do with the battery life just prefer not to have a smartwatch looking watch on my wrist id actually prefer the instinct  solar if it had all the features of my i use huawei gt  realy good sportwatch but i cant see it in your collectioni hate wearing rings or watches so i really never find a tracker i like i wish there was an ankle bracelet version or some version that i could wear on my body that isnt seen or exposedi feel the enduro will go the way of the samsung note where it just becomes a fenix x just like how the samsung note was replaced by samsung s ultragarmin should add real waterproof  inductive buttons to fenix  epix pro series my epix pro lap button died in two months because i was timing my swim laps by pressing the lap button as i touch the wall in the pool such an expensive professional watch should have fully waterproof buttons that dont die in simple lap swimmingno huawei watches they have incredible heart rate sensors dual band gps great battery life and also they look greatmore skews isnt better snd garmin shoots in leg more sales due features is away from competitors thou they can have  watch for each featurewhat about coros apex  prowhat watch do you decide to strap on and go home withanectodal evidence supporting the suunto vertical optical hr findings comes from my own testing i have a suunto vertical garmin fenix  solar sapphire and a garmin forerunner  the suunto hr is absolutely horrible always reads wildly high the garmin watches alse tend to run high in some very specific use cases but removing the watch from my wrist letting the hr reading zero out and putting the watch back on always solves those issues i have never found a fix for the suunto and with all the training features and metrics the app supportsbeing largely based on hr reading during an activity that is a major major bummer i would have that watch on my wrist right nowas the build quality is waybetter than garmin and i like the training metrics better and the battery life is insane but the hr sensor just breaks the deal for medid you test gbd hxmas came early this yearwhat about huawei ultimatei may be an outlier on this but i personally do not want another phone screen the amoled to me is like having another phone screen i would like to buy the garmin fr but the amoled is too much for a watch it is too distracting to me i will be buying the fr for the mip screen it will likely be my last garmin unless they keep providing mip screens for the fr serieswhere are the huawei watches  ultimate  pro  gt recently bought a venu  but the watch feels just so stripped with even the most basic training features like virtual partner removed this is such a simple feature and was even on my  disappointed to say the least going more smartwatch way shouldnt need to mean less training featuresamazfit balancehot take amoled is overrated  im not saying its bad  and im not saying its not hear to stay  im just finding that when i switch back to mip i dont miss the sharper display all that much  i very often wear the enduro  on my left wrist and awu on my right wrist  the mip display doesnt bug me or cause me any issues  works just fine  grandpa rant  obviously epix extra pro  or something of equal silly magnitudei would have loved to also hear what these companies are doing in terms of environmental sustainability as well if everything went to amoled displays maybe the next epix will be called fenix  then the name epix could be in a vault for  years before they test something againmy brothers in christ this youtube video is almost two hours longthe vivoactivevenu naming conventions are so confusingam i the only one who dont get the hype for amoled i genuinely prefer mip screens and would never even consider buying a garmin watch with an amoled screenshould include ecosystems in these reviews that sets apart brands like polarno fr no talk about coros being hostile towards reviewers like dcless watches can i have fewer milk pleasewhere is coros vertix i have the huawei gt  and its gotten only one update and you cant even aware in coming social media calls its just an expensive smart band huawei is calling it a smart watch they need to have social media call answering and more updates they dont care about their smart watch brand i think its only there to have in their brand name huawei you need to shape uptactix bands break in within about  months and after  months it isnt noticeablebattery life is so bad on pixel watch  makes it totally impractical sold mine after a few monthsgarmin need to get rid of the epix line and just call it fenix  amoledif there is no meaningful difference between producing suunto vertical in finland and suunto race in china so why the vertical is so much more expensive than race problem with garmin is they have too many products that are confusing for customers most of their watches use same hardware and features are limited at software level paywallwhere is the whoop i been getting non stop adverts for it last few weeksgarmin needs to increase updates to old watches if i spend  on a watch i want it to last if apple had   day battery life i might dump garmin might watches arent free oh and antapple watch ultra i feel like you guys tend to downplay how important the app integration isfor example casio app suuuuuuuuuucks bad while polar is ok garmin is great zepp app is ok coros is decent galaxy and apple obviously have great apps annd etcthese yearend reviews expose my compulsion to buy new watchesi purchased  of these and last year it was  either ive got to stop buying so many or you have to stop doing these roundupsabout garmin business practicesthey just canceled my order because they didnt like the delivery address well excuse me for living on the wrong side of the tracksso i called reordered and woman on the phone told me if accounting doesnt like the address it will get cancelled againseriously garmini get packages delivered there all the time and you get a wild hair up your ass over my address so i may or may not receive my orderif they cancel on me againi will dump garmin like a hot steaming turdno huawei watchesi feel bad for these poor pigeons flying around just to give us good gps tracksno huawei gt  big mistakegreat running device with way better hr tracking than most garminsgood video but tough to listen to with all the uh hmms while the other person is speaking its not just you guys it happens a lot on youtubewatch nerdsdo we have less watches you should have said  do we have fewer watches good it if you can count them  say feweri gotta ask what the hell do you keep looking at off to your left very distractingmore than  more next year  what an ecological disaster this video isnt nearly long enough  id expect at least  hours for that many watches  next time do better guys  thank you i have the forerunner  i tried out the venu  plus but it didnt have all the performance measurements for training so i couldnt have it for long the forerunner  solves those problems i mainly use the instinct solar insane battery performance on thati was searching for this kind of video thank you for this good quality keep oni have been test driving the epix gen pro sapphire and absolutely love it going on  days out of the box without a charge it still states i have  days left which is amazing im used to my galaxy watch  pro lasting  days max and not doing half as good a job with fitness tracking needless to say ive converted the epix is statyingamazing video quick straight to the point and informative thanksmy first garmin bought  weeks ago epix gen  so cool watch and the battery time is so long the watch is beautiful to look at   as a regular watch as well good video i have the tactix  pro im happy with itinstinct is a refreshing smart watch simple to use does everything i need no fluff or other shiteno model number for the video quite confusing which model for some clipsthis video is such high quality production and great content how come there arent like  comments already this is my first time hearing about garmin thank you for the videothank you for a great video now i know which are the watches i want it now down to only two venus  plus or epixforerunner i need something to track calories burned and set up interval training workoutsi got so sick of smart watches with a day or  of battery life i got a good deal on the instinct and have been so happy with it for me personally i dont care about the screen being amoled at allgreat video thanks im trying to decide on first garmin rather than do standard upgrade to apple watch ultra i like the look of premium build ones as also look so smart when at work  in suit etc worries will regret not having apple but these look so coolgarmin  is the best budget buy for me where do you guys recommend buying fromwhy would you buy any garmin approach watch that has no trade upgood video but forerunners are not mentioned big oversight imhoforerunner i have the fenix s pro sapphire solar  i chose fenix over epix because i have tiny wrists and can only wear the s so i didnt want to sacrifice more battery life to amoled  i really really really love it  it tracks all my workouts and my hikes my swims my sleep its got everything i needhave  new garmin watches the company is not standing behind its product  poor customer service poor company policies except  keep paying and we will update your watchestheres no forerunner seriesas always a great informative reviewi love the venu   i came from years of polar and wanted to try a new ecosystem i  garmin body battery  stress reports are phenomenalbeing a para triathlete this is huge although ive still used garmin i was wondering when they was going to include tracking for handcycling etcthank your for your indepth videos both this video and the comparison video of the venu  and forerunner  helped me making a decision regarding my purchase that was the coolest call done on youtube ever awesome reviews as always thank youreally looking forward to your venu  vs  comparison i really like the step you each walk through the setting and your information is very knowledgeable and firm to learn and understand  keep it up i alway like your detailing and live scroll motion and explanationgreat review

for all the datathank you for the insighful review as always exciting quiet launch of the venu nice reviewwill be interesting to see how the venu  will compare to anticipated upcoming apple watch  and ultra  early request to compare apple watch  vs venu  and apple watch ultra  vs fenix  which pricepoint and features are similarnice review could you make a video for strength training in the venu  to see if theres any improvements to the older garmin watchestop video des well done could you make timeline bookmarks in the longer videos thanks  love the videos btwhey des do you know if the nap tracking will become available on other garmin devices like the  or  any time soonthanksthank you very much desfit for the video as always very interesting one question that is not clear to me about this model does it support multisport mode ive seen that it can be used for open water swimming but i havent seen the multisport option thank youso many models its so confusing already  but thanks for this review are there anymore new models coming out this year cant wait to purchase my first garmin watchthanks for a great review what about hiking which is missing in other lider watches hell that a ton of information  thank u buddy u earned the subscribeddes you are my favorite reviewer of youtube would be interesting a comparison between this watch and the forerunner  they looks so closehey des you fo an really amazing job with this videos do you really think this is the best garmin watch at this point im curious if i should get venu  or epix  an answer would be highly appreciatedawesome didnt got if it has automatic dnd while sleeping thxthe sleep coach is pretty interesting great video againand i thought my google watch was handy might have to make the switch this is seriously impressivegreat video does it broadcast hr for zwift like the venu looking forward to your fr vs venu  comparisonthank youcant wait to see this vs the all i miss is google pay and that would be it for me nice review i am hoping a lot of these new features are coming to my fenixawesome review looking forward to the forerunner comparison so i subscribed brilliant brilliant video  thanks ese crossover fue epicogosh i just love your thoughtful reviews didnt even know this was announced looks like a worthy successor though i miss the metal around the face like in my s or maybe its there and just not obvious in the black color anyway at least i know what to do if my s gets lostif i already have an edge  would the rides that i record be reflected on the venu  and be a good companion between the  devicesi initially wanted a  but held off because of no speakermicrophone i would look at full stats on the phone appdes how does temperature work thx jeff ps excellent review great review sucks that garmin dont do a trade in program do you think its worth upgrading to venu from venu plus id like a bigger watch than the mm venu plus i have and pondering whether this uograde is worth ithi des  is the glass completely flat or does it have a slight bulgelike the fr im concerned with not being able to properly apply a screen protectorgreat video  but a spreadsheet style with whats new would b greatthanks des quick question the garmin launch video briefly showed text images as in when you receive a notification on your phone that contains an image that image will show up in the notification on your venu  can you share more info on this feature app compatibility limitations etci have venu s it honestly is the best lifestyle trackingfitness watch that ive had and its also the best looking onethanks des hard to admit but when you and dcrainmaker publish a review on the same thing on the same day its yours that i watch firstas a beginner medium trainer the venu  is great overall watch  the advance sensor as the pro watches which cost double the ecg test phone assist with answering calls is great wish it was lte mode but in general  love itgreat review as always  so far i am just getting more tired of waiting when all the new feautures will drop to frgreat video as usual  any chance you can post a comparison between the venu  and the epix   i love the epix and im curious how this comparesany input if the sleeping coach would be coming to the  or the venu is that sleep coach gonna come to the epix  thats coolthis is an absolute wonderful review i think im going to return the google pixel  for this watchyou get a like for the tinder function jokenice job desi know it is not a smartwatch primary but would be great if you would test more the notification part as well that could be useful for many thanksi have the original venu which i love  do we think its better to go from that to the  or save some cash and get the  plus wasnt this feature already available in the newer forerunners s and shi desneed an update on  firmware on epix gen  what all included cis a vis pro series looking forwardexcellent video always watch it does it have aerobicanaerobic effect thanks in advancethank you for the video  is the hrvbody battery on the venus  as good as on fenix nice review des  im guessing they did not offer training load metrics as that would cannibalize sales of the forerunner   does that sound accurate  looks nice and it has tennishi are those new features available in epix pro  any measurements of the lug to lug lengthgreat review can you please tell which watch you have on your right wrist it looks stunningwill nap feature come to the forerunner  eventuallyplease release a comparison between fr  and venus  soon we would appreciate iti wish they made a fenix watch that looked like this and had the voice function the venu is lacking too many features for the priceand i want gps maps and backcountry skiing mode i guess forerunner  is the best in between or awu but neither seems as rugged as a fenixepix with sapphire glass and venus look greathow many songs can be loaded onto the watch also can you pick which song to listen to i have the venu s  it can only play playlistsyou cannot pick a specific song in the playlist it either plays in the order of the playlist or you can shufflethanks for the video any thoughts on the venu  vs apple watch series  comparison both are in the same price range and the main difference i found is the battery life what are your recommendationsthoughts the hr sensor on this is best in class in combination with light casinggreat vid but amazon link not up yethey des can you disable the touchscreen during an activity like the fenixi think the best new feature is adding open water swimming which venu doesnt have also dont think venu  has eitherdo notifications from news apps inwta whatsapp etc contain inages or are pocture notificarions for  messages only if picture notifications are enabled for all apps that would be fantasticwow im waiting for the builtin microphone is there any new app to use it to record voice memos like the apple watch does im excited to jump to another boathi des i think i missed an explanation how navigation works  and some screenshots how it looksgreat video very informative which watch are you wearing on your wrist during the videogreat review des thank you if i only care about health metrics and my main activity is weight lifting and just little cardio which one would you choose venu  or does it mean that we can use garmin running dynamics pod with venu  noware the software features of venu coming to venu plusthanks is there a smart wake function nowwhere you can get this data with graphs in the end of videocould you recieve indications of google maps on your venu  if you are using it on your phonedriving a truck effects my fitbit will this add steps while im driving and how durable are the straps and attachmentsis the always on display brighter  compared to the venu  plusgaming tracking mode  i start to feel like athlete soon lolwill update come to venu  plusdes please create video venu  vs venu thank you for a great video does the venu  show actual altitude not just elevation gain want to use it in mountaineeringhiwhat about skin tempetureit is workingif has itthank you for the overview  just got a venu s i cannot locate how to add distance to my indoor cycling workout where would i add that on the watch or on my garmin connect phone app much appreciatedthis might be worth upgrading from my venu sq  just for the double in battery lifehello is there a possibility to listen to audio alerts about the pace during training without headphonesdidnt even know this watch came outdo you know if the respiration rate is now accuratewhat about activities like indoor climbing and bouldering are they still thereand what about all the informations can i watch them also in garmin connect appdo you think that venu can make it during trekking gps accuracyfor example canyon crossing or should i buy epix or fenix looking forward to your venu  vs  comparison still wondering which is a better upgrade from a venu genlooking to buy venu  what size do you think i should get with a mm wristis there an altimeter going to trek everest base camp and need a smartwatchi wish theyll push the nap feature to older devices shouldnt be too complicateddes the amazon affiliate link doesnt seem to be working thanksdoes this have a mode for footballsoccer would be great to be able to track rough distance ran on pitch hesrt rate and even sprints madeim currently using an old beat up  that is showing its age  im on the fence between the venue   the  so looking forward to that next videogiven the lighter weight is the optical heart rate tracking more accurate than the fenix  pro mm thanksi hope they add the ecg in the nearterm i just got one this week and i like it i have fenix  pro too and so its a noticeable difference the pro is that its very lightweight and wristfitting the con is i missing my world time appdoes it have training score pleasealways enjoy your reviews and humoras a female with small wrists i really appreciated you showing both sizes  but i seriously want to know how many people have time for napscompare vs apple watch se  pleasehope the the steps count is more accurate on the venu  music it counts step in sleepwould you recommend it for swimming sports and crossfitdoes this offer turn by turn navlooking forward to watching the fight video   vs venu  hello from strasbourg des  baguettehave garmin improved their incident detection for the venu  do you know i have a venu  and the incident detection occasionally generates false positives unfortunately on the venu even if you spot the false positive and abort the incident detection it still ends the recording of the activity with no way to continue it its a very annoying feature of the devicecould you do a video comparing venu  to the forerunner  switching from apple watch so not sure which is better when switching from applehello can you please tell me if this watch shows ring notifications at all even if it just says ring i dont need to see who is at the door thank youhi des what is limit of the range for calls texts etc is it phone within same room or does it still work say phone upstairs whilst youre downstairscan the venu  be connected to  or more mobile devices simultaneouslyhow does the screen wake up time in wrist gesture mode compare to epix gen  i found the original venu to be just a little too laggy the epix gen  is just good enoughshame it first appeared to have a rotating bezel but i turns out its not ive been using a samsung gear s for about  years now and i love my rotating bezeldont really see much difference between this and venu  plus please advise if you think its worth changingupgrading if one already has a venu  plus looking at replacing my apple watch s looking at the venu  but was wondering whats the best closest to same price closest garmin that has physical buttonsedit i know this has  physical buttons but im talking more about the g shock style watches does the nap also have a score and is added to sleep score at the end of the dayso we can assume that vivoactive  will be delivered in the nearest feature i love transflective display on my vivo any update on the  sleep im thinking of getting onewill some of the new software features get rolled back into venu   plus like the sleep coaching body battery etc etci was very surprised how accurate the gps was on the venu could you do a venu  vs forerunner  comparison i am now going back and forth between the two because it looks like they are so similar thanksis that an official garmin meditation app i see   i dont think we have that on the epixthanks for the review  cant wait for the comparison with the  now to decide which one to buy i dont run but i want to buy a watch for cycling which one would fit the bill better according to you  also i didnt quite understand the last part about vo max can you get it with the venu  or not  do you need a power meter  is there a difference on this side with the  how accurate is it with high bmpdoes the exercise information feed into the apple fitness appwhen is garmin fenix  coming pleaseno trail running modethanks for that review ive seen on the garmin website that you can view photos sent to you on the watch do you know if someone sends me an image in whatsapp if it can be viewed on the watch thanksas a new parent nap time is necessary to make up for the nights where we avg hours lolnow i want to sell my venu  plus  but i wonder if they will have a venu  sqtotal elevation gain on the venue  was really different on the first comparison at timestamp do you think garmin will bring hrv status to the venue  plusis the voice assistant any better than on the  pluswhich garmin watch has the best v max feature thankshow is this vs the new amazfit balancehi when id like to use both an vivo  and an epix pro venu  with its smartphone features as a daily driver and the epix for longer sportstours is there one trainingsreadyness and  trainingsstatus in the connect app what about the sleeptracking has this to be done always with the same watch  greetings tracking napshi thank you for the video does it show current speed for instance while running or biking for me to be able to keep the same speed thank youwhat material is the back made of i had to take my fenix x pro off because of severe redness on my wristdoes it also measures your skin temperature or notdes can the middle button  oclock be totally disabled or how hard is it to accidentally depress that button im a bigger guy who wears his watch close to the wrist and im triggering my assistant constantly with a similar button layout on a fossil anytime i bend my wrist back i told myself id never again buy a watch with that button placement but other than that this looks like my next watch thanksdo we know garmin venu  sq release date i would love to buy itcan you have the screen lock during activities like the forerunner so whats the features ill get going from venu  plus im a little overwhelmed and not an expert to understand all info in this videodesfit this was a super helpful video thank you did you find any difference in the degree of accuracy between the venu  and venu s at all i know sometimes a larger heavier watch can be less accurate than a smaller lighter watch as a female with slender wrists i would be more inclined to choose the s however they dont do a black case option i only want all black everything all the time haha and it means a sacrifice in battery life so those two factors would tempt me towards tolerating a larger watch than would perhaps be ideal for my wrist size however accuracy is what matters at the end of the day thanks  why not a vs garmin  or  how do you compare all the gps tracks in one mapdoes the venu  have a flashlight like the epix pro i seen it in the menus but you didnt sho the hardwareis there an apple watch besides the ultra idk about i can only get a day and some hours with the series  since day oneis the rotating bezel functional like the galaxy watchdid you see my comment on dcrs  new features tested hi could you please provide some information or a video or reference on how the watch works for navigation i am interested in using it for climbing or biking i would like to upload a route as a gpx file and use it as turnbyturn navigation what kind of maps does the watch use if not what external apps can be used for this is this watch suitable for my needsgarmin is at a point where they need to simplify their product line  generations ago there were clear differences between feature sets at this point all of these watches do more than  of what most users need the difference between this and an epix or fenix is pretty marginaldesfit if you dont care about notifications or phone calls but you care about sport and fitness what would you choose the forerunner  or this venu  does this new sensor really make a huge differencegreat vid super funny you called ray because i have his video queued up next to watch also will be on the lookout for the  maybe add some  perspective too comparison viddoes venu  series come with training effect and readinessdoes venu  have the same golf support in the venu  plusstill waiting for comparison video with fr  what will i missed if i pick up venu  instead of the only concern about this device is the launch price  euros is a bit too much considering other brandsis it worth it to upgrade from the venu  hmm i bought the fr last year and love it but i wish it had the ability to talk and text the venu  looks like it does everything the fr does plus talk and text darn you garmin anyone know what a fr can do that this canthello i have a quick question hoping you can help the voice assistant do you know if you can use that to audibly add a calendar event into your google calendar   in my vehicle i say hey google make me a calendar entry it then asks me whats the title of your event  i say whatever it is it asks me if i want to save it etc trying to find out if the voice assistant on this watch works the same thanksi do x a week crossfit how can i use venu  for crossfitis the display smoother than epix  my epix  feels lagging when i am swiping down the glancesdesfit do you have any idea if garmin will add the triathlon mode to the venu   due to the fact it now can track open water swim it would be nice to see it on the venu  for the not pro athlete triathloner do we know when nap tracking comes on other devicesfenix epix etcwhen i got fenix  and i realise that such an expensive watch wont track naps i went bananascant wait fr the  comparison  theyre the exact same price with a lot of similarities so im really on the fence upgrading from st gen venudoes the venue  have a built in kayaking activity i know the venue  does notwhat is the quality of haptics i had fenix x and epix gen  and both were no where near the quality of apple watch for instance did the vibration improve how would you rate this against suunto race which i am also consideringreally looking forward to the venu  with  days always on display what a shiny new garmin yes i want one can you send me yours after youre done reviewing pleaseits a shame garmin does not have a vivoactive imagine all the battery life you can get if they had used a transflective displaydid they fix the bands issue i had a venu  plus that rd party bands would fall off of does the training loadstatus information match that of the fenix series does it provide the same information in the connect app i am not really cincerned about training readiness but i do use the training load function and it is unclear how much of that data made its way to this watchproblem is that this costs x the garmin venu  price where i live which still costs almost the same as it did approx  years ago making the venu  a completely other price category big nono for an upgrade for mea lot of this just feels like software updates that could and should be on the venu  plus or even the venu difference with this venu  and forerunner  please des i have venu  for  years just bought forerunner  and just dont like it  i cant add my own watch face from the connect iq app can only use faces already on the   well i definitely dont want that because of my eyesight  years old plus the  screen is not as big as i was visually expecting it to be many thanks for your fantastic in depth video fenix x pro solarive watched all the review because im new to the channel and because im really interested in the new venue unfortunately you didnt say anything about if sleep tracking is good and reliable or not and i understand it is not simple as measure hearth it etc but thats it if a company pushes a lot about a feature we should find if its saying the truth before spending  like my samsung galaxy watch lots of features and everything but then a lot in sport and health tracking is wrong how is this compared to the samsung watch  classic  looking to upgradealso i  use a google pixel  procan anyone tell me what the venu  is missing with its features compared to garmin  does venu  have trainibg readiness and so onhow many years of software updates does garmin providehow will you compare this vs the  looking to make a decision between the  rangesi think it it such a good move that you have a lot of screen time of the venu  just on you wrist and shooting from above this shot while you are swiping through the menus makes it very cleari want all the health sensors and fitness sensors and also i want mp music in my watch which garmin or any other watch do you recommend i really dont care about lte or messages in that watch only health and finess includding vo max gps tracking without a cell phone health reports etc thank yougood review i dont get though how the venu  is different enough from the forerunner  and both are rather bad value compared to the pace  i enjoy the garmin ecosystem it has many motivatiors but i also feel like they increased their prices sharply over the past  months not gonna spend close to  euro for a watch when the pace  is half of that i even prefer mip screens to oled currently on an oled watchlooks like a proper upgrade to my venu  but sadly they dont offer a sapphire option what for example the galaxy watch  offers for  less my venu s display got scratched heavily after a very short time of usedo you have an apple watch  vs the venu  slated to review ive been an apple watch user for  years but havent been able to make a choice on what garmin is best for meive got a specific question  i currently have the garmin edge  and a polar h chest hrmwhat happens if i also go riding with the venu  which hrm would the garmin take input from hi quick question you say you can make a call if your within range of your phone how farlong is the range that you can make a call or recieve textsame old venu training effectjust bought samsung watch  classic mm just to try im gonna sell it and buy venu is it fair to say that the venu  is a better pick over the  for someone that does an equal mix of hiit sprintingweight liftingcyclingwalks  it seems like its more of an allrounder versus the  which is very running centric the th gen hr monitor looks like a big upgrade for accurately tracking hr for hiit hill sprints and weight liftingfor me one of the most important feature that is missing on venu compared to forerunner series is the ability to resumelater does that feature exist on venudoes it have training readinessthank you for being probably the only reviewer online that not only told the viewers how big your wrist was but also showed both models next to each other for comparison not even findable on the website of garmin so please keep it up and thanks for your workcan i ask something when i try to make a call it in the venu  the microphone and the speaker doesnt work at all what should i do to fix that problemcan you switch to wheelchair mode directly from the watch pleasei am having a hardest time to choose between venu vs fenix  i love venu with design but it doesnt have a map but fenix is durable but not a best fit for dress up purposedoes the hrv show in the app or is it a fake hrv as someone called itworth it upgrading from the venu  plus i bought it less than  weeks agono training load or training effectstill waiting for the venu  vs forerunner  comparison no compass and baro on glanceswhats the difference between venu  vs forerunner the one you are wearingwhats the difference between the venu  and the  i recently bought the  and should still be within the return windowlets hope that garmin does the right thing and bring software updates to the current venu  which includes some of those features notably the hrv recovery and sleep training features otherwise garmin is going to turn into a hot potato brand which one would just like to drop in favour for brands that continue to support and update their productswhat language are you learning on duolingovenu  has navigation and maps like in fenixepix watchesi am confused shall i go with this or forerunner is there a big difference between this and venu  plus hy how long is the vibration by an incoming phonecall the same do the venu  plus  or x wie epix mfgis it medically certifiedvenu   fr  triathlon  various modes  micspeaker  sleep coach bigger displayvenu  or fenix hello please could you help me out hereive just received my garmin venu  is it possible to access my contacts on the venu  watch that l have stored on my apple iphonewhy compare it to the  and not the  forerunneryou showed how the voice assistant works when iphone is unlocked but the only use case of using the voice assistant is to use it when the iphone is in the pocket for example hence the main question is how voice assistant would behave when phone is locked and in the pocket also i noticed that you havent mentioned that sometimes users experience lag in va work is this review just an advertisement of the product or real reviewvenu  plus or venu  do these ever go on sale best time to buyhi can you please test the open water activities for this thankswait did i just see gaming on activity list   wtf the price is crazy considering the newly released amazfit balance which beats this watch in every spec on paper and is at half the pricedoes this have a moon phaseno ecg support  i was looking forward to this venu  guess i will nee to settle for the  plusi own a venu  not plus do you think it worth the upgrade i will notice real world improvementscan use an apple watch ultra and a garmin  at the same time on one iphone  pro max or an apple watch ultra and one of these in this videoif this has a google wallet app or similar i might just ditch my galaxy watch for the venu  its really the only smart watch feature i need and use regularlywould you say the mm is too big for a womans wrist seems like it i have an aw mm and will buy the venu but the  looks way bigger while the  i dont know yet suggestionshey des great review do you think well get the sleep coach and naps feature on the newly released fenix pro and epix pro i still watched the whole review even though i just upgraded from the x to the epix pro based on yours and rays reviews can this watch be charged wirelesslygreat review as always i love this watch might be the model suitable for my walletthis watch starting at  is a lil too expensive for me garmin seems to be a niche brand with their high pricingits fascinating how the new sensors arent better than the old ones  looking at that bioengineer guy who tests watches against medical level test equipment the garmin watches are kinda lumped together on his graph old and new sensor watches all togethernote im a garmin userlover my comment is about the new sensor doesnt seem like a huge upgradedoes it have maps if they didnt add maps then it is worthlesswent back to using a normal watch as much as possible and only my garmin when running to measure distance and hr these watches were just too integrated into our lives like wtf everyone should be able to figure out their sleep quality without a toolcan this new sleep coach wake you up when it thinks you have already rested welldoes it have everything vivo  also has does someone know if the venu  is working normally even with a tattooed arm i have problems with the apple watch  it cant read my heart rate  with my garmin instinct  its working better  but not alwaysdesfit can you do a comparison between the forerunner  and garmin venu  it would also be a great video seeing as all  watches came out within  monthsspecifically are the following missing in the garmin venu  exercise load aerobic and anaerobic during workout endurance score hill score mapping during running run metrics like cadenceforerunner  or venu ive had the venu  for almost  years was looking forward to the venu  kinda disappointed doesnt look any differentwhere is youtube music months ago there was news that google was going to allow or provide an app for this i hear the venue  interface is very laggy is that truewireless chargingso still no training load recovery or advanced running metrics from garmins chest strap quite disappointing m deeply dissapointed of my fenixx pro for not being able to track sleep why on earth am i forced to set sleeping interval i work in shifts and i sleep x hours a day most of the timesoooo disappointed some nice little additions clean design and improved accuracy which is great also expectedbutno g  lteno ecgno blood pressureits a step backwards from venu  plus imogreat video thank youcan i use maps is there any app in the world garmin can let me install and use maps easy with  clickhow about apple musictoo many models and i decided not to buy i need the ecg function on the epix but it doesnt have itit seems to be a great watch i dont like the ui in some parts the rounded gradient lines in the widget view looks awful also some graphs within the widgets what the hell are the white top corners it seems they are playing with ui rules from early s just to focus on many colors of the oled looks like made for kids i wish the would make a better simple ui i also dont like the ui from the forerunner  it also looks childish i hope garmin will let the clear design language in the fenixepix watches but here my wish is to bring the bigger nicer font of venu watches i also dislike the  euros higher price germanybut no lteif any garmin employee is watching please make the epix  with small bezels like this watch since its the most expensive watch thank you another new garmin watch without wireless charging im still with my fr waiting for wireless chargingwhen my apple watch battery loses more capacity this or similar garmin watch will be my next one the fact apple hasnt increased the battery life of the apple watch to date is unacceptablelots of new functionality here but garmin missed a huge opportunity with that swipe right  tinder option   this or epix  steel version for  euros here in nl i just got my fenix for  euros think the v is kinda overpriced no training readiness no navigation no multibandedit  i had the one with titanium band selectedit didnt track my nap no pause for training resume later come on garmin wtffirstugh still no pace proim not really a fan of their color choices for the uiimo the amazfit gtr  offers a ton more value and cost  percent less  plus the amazfit has an excellent phonemic speaker that works flawlessly  also does text and full amoled etc and it gets  weeks on a charge  its really hard to pay over  for this when the competition offers similar specked devices for well under half that cost  plus the amazfit has a magnetic charger which is superior to having to plug a cable into the device  and will likely have less chance for cable terminal failure  however if controlling bt music with watch and doing voice assistance is important to you with a watch id get the garmin  however for me when i do those things its just easier to use the phone app  the amazfit seems to put the things you need that you will actually use on a watch at a much better price pointif this thing had pacepro it would be perfect for me what a shamevertical screen scrolling in garmin is crap this doesnt fit the small touchscreen your finger keeps covering the screen which doesnt happen with the horizontal oneneither you nor ray commented on the quality of the watch is it because its as plasticky as it looksno gsm phone in this watch  i think a watch like the ticwatch  pro makes the venu  have difficulties to justify the price tag i am leaning towards getting the ticwatch  procan reply  with keyboard to emailssmswhatappsteam chat i need answer before buy  thanksno maps no buy the  is what i wanted the original venu to be back in  and the venu  is what the  that just came out a couple months shouldve been theres really no need for a venu series at this point if its essentially a stripped down  with for whatever reason more detailed health metrics than the  why inflate the market when you can just release one high end do it all watch the epix and then a cheaper alternative the combination of a venu  which is competitively priced with the standard apple watch and have it be miles ahead of the apple watch anything else is truly a waste of time and money for the consumerultra is still betterstill no lte suppoort pointlesscan i use youtube like for  hours straightthe biggest flaw i have with the venu is how abysmal the ui is like why does it move like something from come on garmin give us wireless charging \n","['old', 'very', 'experienced', 'runner', 'first', 'marathon', 'in', 'here', 'i', 'currently', 'run', 'with', 'the', 'forerunner', 'i', 'am', 'thinking', 'about',
